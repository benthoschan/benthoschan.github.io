In addition to my research activities and from 2018 to 2021, I was a lead organizing member of the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) Professional Learning Community known as Unpacking Diversity, which started in 2017 as a graduate student-driven initiative. Our work stemmed from a desire to create a more inclusive community within our college and in the geosciences. The CEOAS PLC hosted a year-long seminar series called, "Unpacking Diversity", which brought lecturers from the Oregon State University community to facilitate discussions surrounding social justice, equity, and inclusion. You can learn more about our work and our past sessions at our [website](https://unpackingdiversity.wixsite.com/CEOAS).
