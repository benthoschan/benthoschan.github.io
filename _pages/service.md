In addition to my research activities and as of the summer of 2018, I have been an active organizing member of the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) Professional Learning Community, which started in 2017 as a graduate student-driven initiative. Our work stems from a desire to create a more inclusive community within our college and in the geosciences. The CEOAS PLC hosts a year-long seminar series called, "Unpacking Diversity", which brings lecturers from the Oregon State University community to facilitate discussions surrounding social justice, equity, and inclusion. You can learn more about our work and our past sessions at our [website](https://unpackingdiversity.wixsite.com/CEOAS).
