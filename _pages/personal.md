As for hobbies and non-work-related activities, I am mostly just your average introvert. I love fiction novels, streaming television, casual sketching, etc. Additionally, I enjoy learning languages and can speak, read, and understand, to some degree, Mandarin Chinese, German (rusty, but studied for 6 years), and Japanese. I am currently working on becoming proficient in Japanese.

Regarding my motile life (because research can promote a sedentary one), I practice kendo with the Oregon State University Kendo Club. Prior to this, I practiced ninjutsu for four years.
