I am a masters student in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University pursuing a degree in Ocean Ecology and Biogeochemistry. My primary interest is to understand the impacts of bioturbation on elemental cycling in nearshore environments. My masters thesis combines biogeochemical and ecological data collected from the Oregon shelf-slope and numerical modelling to understand how bioturbation and bioirrigation impacts iron and sulfur cycling on the Oregon coastal margin.

In 2013, I graduated with a BSc in Animal Biology from the University of Guelph, after which I pursued a second BSc in Marine Biology from Dalhousie University. During my time at Dalhousie, I became intersted in sediment biogeochemistry under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Algar. My undergraduate thesis focused on assessing shifts in the cycling of nitrogen in sediments impacted by large depositional fluxes of organic matter from salmonid aquaculture operations using reaction transport models.
