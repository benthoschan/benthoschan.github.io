I am a PhD student in the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University 
pursuing a degree in Ocean Ecology and Biogeochemistry under Dr. Clare E. Reimers. My primary interest is to understand the impacts of 
bioturbation and bioirrigation on elemental cycling in nearshore environments. For my masters thesis, I developed an early diagenetic model 
to simulate iron cycling in sediments of two sites offshore of the Siltcoos River on Heceta Bank (OR). As part of my doctoral work, I aim to further develop
this model to improve model accuracy and will use it to assess how bottom trawling in a newly reopened rockfish conservation area may impact
iron cycling along the Oregon continental margin. 

In 2013, I graduated with a BSc in Animal Biology from the University of Guelph, after which I pursued a second BSc in Marine Biology from Dalhousie University. During my time at Dalhousie, I became intersted in sediment biogeochemistry under the guidance of Dr. Christopher Algar. My undergraduate thesis focused on assessing shifts in the cycling of nitrogen in sediments impacted by large depositional fluxes of organic matter from salmonid aquaculture operations using reaction transport models.
