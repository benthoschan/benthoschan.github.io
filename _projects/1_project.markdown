For my MS thesis, I am modelling the effects of bioturbation and bioirrigation on iron and sulfur cycling on the Oregon shelf-slope. The project itself consists of two parts: a reaction transport model and an ecological assessment of macrofauna based on their activities, categorized into either 'bioirrigator' and 'biomixer'.
