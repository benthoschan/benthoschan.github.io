<p>In addition to my research activities, I aim to increase diversity and support social justice initiatives in the geosciences. Since 2018, I have been an organizing member of the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS) Professional Learning Community at Oregon State University. As part of our activities, we organize the seminar series, 'Unpacking Diversity', which seeks to spark conversations around diversity, equity, and inclusion, especially in the context of geoscience and college climate. We also work in collaboration with graduate students in the Department of Integrative Biology (College of Science) to host a keynote university-wide talk. You can learn more about our initiative and our past sessions at <a href="https://unpackingdiversity.wixsite.com/CEOAS">our website</a>.</p>
