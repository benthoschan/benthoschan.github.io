	abstract = {We determined patterns of benthic metabolism and examined the relative importance of denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) as sinks for nitrate (NO3−) in intertidal sediments in the presence and absence of benthic microalgal (BMA) activity. By influencing the activity of BMA, light regulated the metabolic status of the sediments, and, in turn, exerted strong control on sediment nitrogen dynamics and the fate of inorganic nitrogen. A pulsed addition of 15N-labeled NO3− tracked the effect and fate of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the system. Under illuminated conditions, BMA communities influenced benthic fluxes directly, via DIN uptake, and indirectly, by altering the oxygen penetration depth. Under dark hypoxic and anoxic conditions, the fate of water column NO3− was determined largely by three competing dissimilatory reductive processes; DNF, DNRA, and, on one occasion, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Mass balance of the added 15N tracer illustrated that DNF accounted for a maximum of 48.2\% of the 15NO3− reduced while DNRA (a minimum of 11.4\%) and anammox (a minimum of 2.2\%) accounted for much less. A slurry experiment was employed to further examine the partitioning between DNF and DNRA. High sulfide concentrations negatively impacted rates of both processes, while high DOC:NO3− ratios favored DNRA over DNF.},

	abstract = {Nitrate and ammonium are the most important nitrogen sources for phytoplankton growth. Differential utilization of inorganic nitrogenous compounds by phytoplankton has been observed and may have significant impacts on primary productivity at local scales. We used enrichment experiments with natural phytoplankton populations from the freshwater tidal zone of the Guadiana estuary, a coastal ecosystem increasingly subjected to anthropogenic influences, to study the effects of nitrate and ammonium on N-consumption and phytoplankton growth. In addition, we used combined additions of nitrate and ammonium to understand the inhibitory effect of ammonium over nitrate uptake. Ammonium concentrations in the freshwater tidal reaches of the Guadiana estuary throughout the sampling period were too low to exert an inhibitory effect on nitrate uptake or a toxic effect on phytoplankton growth. Nitrate was clearly the main nitrogen source for phytoplankton at the study site. Overall, nitrate seemed to become limiting at concentrations lower than 20 mu M and N-limitation was particularly significant during summer. A trend of decreasing nitrate uptake with increasing ammonium concentrations and uptake suggested an overall preference for ammonium. However, preference for ammonium was group-specific, and it was observed mainly in green algae and cyanobacteria. In fact, cyanobacteria relied only on ammonium as their N-source. On the contrary, diatoms preferred nitrate, and did not respond to ammonium additions. The increasing eutrophication in the Guadiana estuary and particularly increased inputs of nitrogen as ammonium due to urban waste effluents may result in a shift in phytoplankton community composition, towards a dominance of cyanobacteria and green algae.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.10.054},
	abstract = {This paper presents an ecosystem modelling approach aimed at improving shellfish aquaculture management by explicitly considering natural benthic biodiversity. This methodology uses a combination of benthic field survey data, sediment and bathymetric mapping, physiological models and dynamic ecosystem modelling. The Wild species Integration for Shellfish Ecoaquaculture (WISE) approach helps to understand the baseline food requirements for maintaining natural benthic biodiversity of suspension-feeding organisms, thus informing managers on potential upper thresholds for shellfish aquaculture. WISE was tested in four coastal systems in Europe and China, including bays, estuaries and sea loughs with widely differing aquaculture activities. In the European systems, where the aquaculture industry is developing, species diversity and abundance are much higher and suspension-feeding wild species play an important role in the consumption of food resources. Densities of wild individuals were estimated to be 13 ind m- 2 in Sanggou Bay (total: 2 ?? 109), 33??ind m- 2 in Xiangshan Gang (total: 122 ?? 109), 95??ind m- 2 in Carlingford Lough (total: 4.62 ?? 109) and 175??ind m- 2 in Loch Creran (total: 2.62 ?? 109). Total clearance rates by wild populations were calculated as 5\% of the total volume d- 1 in Sanggou Bay (75 ?? 106??m3 d- 1), 11\% d- 1 in Xiangshan Gang (434 ?? 106??m3 d- 1), 40\% d- 1 in Loch Creran (93 - 99 ?? 106??m3 d- 1) and 45\%??d- 1 in Carlingford Lough (170-250 ?? 106??m3 d- 1). In relative terms, wild populations play a more important role than cultivated shellfish in clearing suspended particles from the European systems due to the much lower aquaculture activity. 56\% and 76\% of total primary production in Loch Creran and Carlingford Lough, respectively, are consumed annually by wild organisms, while less than 50\% is consumed in Chinese systems (45\% in Sanggou Bay and 2.9\% in Xiangshan Gang). Integration of the WISE approach within broader ecological modelling illustrates some of the trade-offs between commercial aquaculture and the conservation of biodiversity, showing that rates of and capacities for shellfish culture are reduced when both wild and cultured suspension-feeding species are considered in relation to the available seston. When food resources are partitioned between wild and cultivated species, there is a decrease in individual length and weight (9 to 22\% reduction in shell length and 24 to 52\% reduction in total fresh weight for the Pacific oyster; reductions of 6\% in length and 20\% in weight for blue mussel; reductions of 4\% in length and 13\% in individual weight for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang), resulting in a lower aquaculture production (e.g. for Pacific oyster, a reduction of 12.5\% in Carlingford Lough, 34\% in Loch Creran and of 9\% for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang). ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {There is a need in the marine research and management communities for a clear operational definition of the term, eutrophication. I propose the following: eutrophication (noun) - an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem. This definition is consistent with historical usage and emphasizes that eutrophication is a process, not a trophic state. A simple trophic classification for marine systems is also proposed: [GRAPHICS] Various factors may increase the supply of organic matter to coastal systems, but the most common is clearly nutrient enrichment. The major causes of nutrient enrichment in coastal areas are associated directly or indirectly with meeting the requirements and desires of human nutrition and diet. The deposition of reactive nitrogen emitted to the atmosphere as a consequence of fossil fuel combustion is also an important anthropogenic factor. The intensity of nitrogen emission from fertilizer, livestock waste, and fossil fuel combustion varies widely among the countries of the world. It is strongest in Europe, the northeastern United States, India/Pakistan, Japan/Korea, and the Caribbean. This geographical distribution corresponds with many areas where coastal marine eutrophication has become a recent concern. Demographic and social trends suggest that past practices leading to coastal nutrient enrichment are likely to be repeated in the coming decades in the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.},

Previous work focused on fluxes of N solutes and gases, but the effects on microbes responsible for N transformations are unknown. In May 2010, we deployed eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in mesh cages above sand-filled boxes at four sites across a nutrient gradient in Jamaica Bay, New York City. In fall and winter, we used quantitative PCR to measure abundance of 16S rRNA and nitrite reductase genes for denitrification (nirS and nirK) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (nrfA) in sediment. We measured water column nutrients and chlorophyll a, sediment C:N and organic matter (OM), exchangeable ammonium (NH4 +), ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification potential (DNP). Oysters did not affect gene abundance in fall, when we predicted that their influence would be strongest, or in winter. However, gene abundance was significantly different among sites and seasons. Factors which explained 16S rRNA, nirS, and nirK gene abundance included sediment OM, water column N, and chlorophyll a, similar to previous research. Abundance of nrfA was lower than that of nir genes and positively related to sediment C:N, suggesting OM lability may drive the balance between nir and nrfA. Finally, nirS and nirK abundance was unrelated to DNP, which is consistent with variable results from the literature. More studies that combine molecular techniques with N transformation rates in the context of oyster reefs are needed. Results will advance models which predict the ecosystem effects of reef conservation and restoration under variable environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {The present study focuses on the development of a standard methodology for selection of suitable sites for o¡shore (exposed) marine ¢sh-cage farming ({\textbackslash}poundsoating cages) of seabream (Sparus aurata)and sea- bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in an island environment, using Tenerife as an example. Site selection is a key factor in any aquaculture operation, a¡ecting both success and sustainability and can solve con{\textbackslash}poundsicts be- tween di¡erent activities, making a rational use of the coastal space. Site selection was achieved by using geographical information systems (GIS)-based models and related technology to support the deci- sion-making process. The framework for spatialmul- ticriteria decision analysis used in this study began with a recognition and de¢nition of the decision pro- blem. Subsequently,31production functions (factors and constraints) were identi¢ed, de¢ned and subdi- vided into eight submodels. These were then inte- grated into a GIS database in the form of thematic layers and later scored for standardization. At this stage, the database was veri¢ed by ¢eld sampling to establish the quality of data used. The decision ma- ker's preferences were incorporated into the decision model by assigning weights of relative importance to the evaluation under consideration. These, together with the thematic layers, were incorporated using multicriteria evaluation techniques and simple over- lays to provide an overall assessment of possible alternatives. The integration, manipulation and pre- sentation of the results by means of GIS-based mod- els in this sequential and logical {\textbackslash}poundsow of steps proved to be very e¡ective for helping the decision-making process of site selection. Tenerife has very favourable environmental conditions for culture of marine ¢sh and there are no totally unsuitable sites for cage farming identi¢ed in this study. On the other hand, there are few very suitable sites (high scores) either, principally due to the heavy use of the coastline and the con{\textbackslash}poundsicts between di¡erent users. From the 228 km2 of available area for sitingcages inthe coast- al regions with depth less than 50m, the total area suitable for siting cages (scores 6{\textasciicircum}8) was 37 km2. There are only 0.51km2 of very suitable areas (score 8) and approximately 5.37 km2 of suitable (score 7), most of these being located in the southeast of the is- land.These relatively small areas of suitability should be put into the context of thewider use of the coastal environment aroundTenerife.},

	abstract = {The fate of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in aquatic ecosystems is intimately linked to the cycling of organic matter. In this paper, we present a model of the effect of organic matter decomposition on the distribution of persistent organic pollutants in sediments. The model predicts a diagenetic (sediment-ageing) magnification of chemical concentrations in sediments enriched with labile organic matter. We predict two- to four-fold diagenetic magnification across a wide range of realistic parameter values, and higher levels (up to 20-fold) for labile organic matter in systems with low burial rates (i.e., residence times on the order of years). As an illustration, we apply our model to understand the fate of waste organic matter and associated PCBs discharged by marine fish farms. The available data support both the spatial pattern (as a function of burial rate) and the range of sediment PCB concentrations predicted by our model. This model explains why equilibrium models fail to predict the very high sediment-water partitioning coefficients often observed in the field. Effectively, diagenetic processes impose an additional biomagnification step at the bottom of the detritus-based food web, increasing the exposure to POPs of organisms at higher trophic levels. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We compared the models regarding direct and indirect responses to fishing on one or more species.

Microbial nitrogen (N) transformations at the sediment-water interface are important in determining system productivity and the development and maintenance of hypoxia. Intact sediment cores were incubated in a continuous-flow system with stable isotope tracers to identify and quantify important N sources (e.g., N fixation), sinks (e.g., denitrification and anammox), and links (e.g., dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, DNRA). Microbial N sinks on the Louisiana-Texas continental shelf remove up to 68 \% of the total N load from the Mississippi River watershed, and up to 29 \% of this N removal (mean = 11.8 +/- 1.7 \%) may be due to anammox. The highest N-2 production rates and ammonium effluxes were observed at low bottom-water oxygen concentrations, and sediments were a significant source of ammonium to the water column at all times. DNRA and heterotrophic N fixation were not consistent pathways for total sediment N fluxes, but their potential importance to N balance and productivity in the system warrants further study and inclusion in ecosystem models. Physical disturbance from passage of two hurricanes in 2008 resulted in lower N cycling rates and sediment oxygen consumption, with sediment processes migrating into the water column. Denitrification is the dominant N sink in the northern Gulf of Mexico and provides a valuable ecosystem service by mitigating N loads from the Mississippi River watershed, particularly during seasonal bottom-water hypoxia events.},

	abstract = {California's commercial fisheries harvested many dif-ferent species of finfish and invertebrates from 1928 to 2001. A time series of the landings from waters off California was created to examine changes in the species composition, weight, and value of the landings. Small coastal pelagic fishes dominated the landings weight until the late 1980s, when landings of invertebrates increased. Tunas, groundfish, salmon, crabs, sea urchins, and squid have all contributed significantly to the value of the land-ings. Value and landings were affected by domestic and international market conditions. The availability of cer-tain species, especially coastal pelagics, has varied in response to decadal-scale changes in environmental con-ditions, and tunas, herring, and squid varied with in-teryear environmental warming from California El Niño events. The depletion and subsequent regulation of many of the stocks, including several rockfish, have contributed to declines in their landings over time. Invertebrates be-came more important in both the weight and value of landings in the 1990s. The declining trend in the total value of landings, despite increased total landings, raises concern for the future of the fishing economy.},

The papers used covered a wide range of farmed species, geographic regions, management practices and specific site characteristics (e.g., depth, exposure, and sediment type). Therefore, the total data-set may not be considered as biased towards a particular set of conditions as is often the case with data collected in a single study. More than 120 biological and geochemical variables were monitored, occasionally using different sampling and analytical protocols for the same variables. The rank correlation analysis between all possible pairs of variables in the data set showed a large number of significant positive or negative correlations, reflecting the response of these variables to benthic organic enrichment. The use of stepwise regression showed that most biological and geochemical variables are determined by a combination of distance from the farm with bottom depth and/or latitude. Results of stepwise regression, repeated separately for each type of sediment, showed that although the general pattern was similar among different types of sediments, the coefficients varied considerably indicating changes of the distance affected by settling particulate organic material for different sediment types. The overall conclusion is that the complicated interactions between variables and the lack of data, such as current speed, induce difficulties in setting common or uniform environmental quality standards for benthic effects of fish farming and these should take into account the existing considerable differences between geographic regions, depth zones and sediment types. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The vertical distribution of DEN activity was examined using the acetylene inhibition technique combined with N2O microsensor measurements, whereas NH4+ production via DNRA was measured with a recently developed gel probe-stable isotope technique. At all field sites, dissimilatory nitrate reduction was clearly dominated by DEN (59–131\% of the total NO3− reduced) rather than by DNRA, irrespective of the sedimentary inventories of electron donors such as organic carbon, sulfide, and iron. Highest ammonium production via DNRA, accounting for up to 8.9\% of the total NO3− reduced, was found at a site with very high concentrations of total sulfide and NH4+ within and below the layer in which NO3− reduction occurred. Sediment from two field sites, one with low and one with high DNRA activity in the core incubations, was also used for slurry incubations. Now, in both sediments high DNRA activity was detected accounting for 37–77\% of the total NO3− reduced. These contradictory results might be explained by enhanced NO3− availability for DNRA bacteria in the sediment slurries compared to the core-incubated sediments in which diffusion of NO3− from the water column may only reach DEN bacteria, but not DNRA bacteria. The true partitioning of dissimilatory nitrate reduction between DNRA and DEN may thus lie in between the values found in whole core (underestimation of DNRA) and slurry incubations (overestimation of DNRA).},

The two main species cultured are the introduced Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. Legislation has been introduced to assist the development of aquaculture, and this includes requirements for environmental management, such as baseline assessments and routine monitoring of leases. Local impacts on the seabed around salmon farms are monitored using video footage, analysis of benthic invertebrate infauna, and chemical measures (redox and organic matter). Monitoring of shellfish farms is minimal because our research has shown that shellfish culture is having little impact on the environment. Research related to management of aquaculture wastes is ongoing. Studies include investigating appropriate inexpensive measures for an industry-wide long-term monitoring program. Mitigation measures against excessive loadings of organic matter from fish farms, mainly by fallowing, i.e. rotating the position of fish pens around a lease, are currently being researched. Rates of recovery of a heavily impacted salmon lease area after the removal of fish have also been studied. A new project is investigating system-wide effects of salmon farming on the environment, in particular, increased release of nutrients into waterways. This includes monitoring dissolved oxygen, nutrients and phytoplankton, modelling the system, and investigating ecological indicators of eutrophication. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The effects of salmon farm inputs on pelagic nutrient concentrations and planktonic mi- crobial abundance and biomass were investigated in Loch Fyne, a temperate fjordic environment off the west coast of Scotland. The concentration of photosynthetic pigments and inorganic and organic nutrients, and the abundance and biomass of the autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms, were determined over a complete annual cycle from 3 depths (5, 15 and 25–30 m) at 4 stations located at differing proximities to the fish farm. Ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations and heterotrophic microbial abundance and biomass were significantly higher at the stations nearest to the fish farm, suggesting that these and other nutrients derived from the fish farm may be directly or indirectly enhancing heterotrophic microbial activity. This in turn suggests that the heterotrophic microbial food web was responsible, at least in part, for processing matter and energy released into the pelagic environment from the salmon farm. By contrast, pigment concentrations, including chlorophyll a, tended to be similar at all stations, supporting the conclusions of previous studies that failed to estab- lish a clear relationship between fish farm inputs and phytoplankton biomass. As such, the response of the heterotrophic microbial community is probably a more appro-priate indicator than chlorophyll concentration of local ecological effects of fish farms in temperate coastal waters.

A switch in the redox status of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) pool in the well at the upland/saltmarsh interface occurred over the spring-neap tidal transition: the DIN pool was dominated by nitrate during spring tide and by ammonium during neap tide. A density-dependent reaction-transport model was used to investigate the relative importance of individual processes to the observed N redox-switch. The observed N redox-switch was evaluated with regard to the roles of nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), ammonium adsorption, and variations in inflowing water geochemistry between spring and neap tides. Transport was driven by measured pressure heads and process parameterizations were derived from field observations, targeted laboratory experiments, and the literature. Modeling results suggest that the variation in inflow water chemistry was the dominant driver of DIN dynamics and highlight the importance of spring-neap tide variations in the high marsh, which influences groundwater biogeochemistry at the marsh-upland transition. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The first investigation of seaweed chemical defense against herbivores involved the brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus and suggested defense via phlorotan-nins. The first demonstration of seaweed induction of secondary metabolites in response to herbivory also involved the genus Fucus and assumed a defensive function for phlorotannins. Many other investigations correlate herbivore feeding preference with changing levels of phlorotannins in this genus and others, but few directly test the effects of phlorotannins. No studies have assessed Fucus chemical defenses using bioassay-guided separation to investigate the complete complement of compounds deterring herbivores. We investigated the deterrence of F. vesiculosus chemical extracts using herbivore bioassays to guide our chemical investigations. Although crude extracts from F. vesiculosus strongly deterred feeding by the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata, phlorotannins from this extract did not deter feeding at 2 or 4 natural concentration by dry mass. Feeding deterrence was due to: (1) a polar galactolipid in the ethyl acetate-soluble extract, and (2) a non-phenolic compound, or compounds, in the water-soluble extract. Although this is the first evidence of galactolipids deterring herbivores, such defenses could be geographi-cally and taxonomically widespread. The galactolipid we discovered in Fucus occurs in marine dinoflagellates, and a related metabolite that deters herbivory has recently been discovered in a tropical green seaweed. We were unable to identify the second deterrent compound, but deterrence occurred in a fraction containing carbohy-drates, including sulfated sugars, but no phlorotannins. Given the polarity of these chemical deterrents, they could co-occur with and confound bioassays of phlorotan-nins if investigators test phlorotannin-containing algal extracts without further purification.},

Global warming occurs at elevated rates in Greenland and results in changing species distributions with range expansions to the north and new species entering terrestrial habitats from the south. There is, however, no quantitative knowledge of past or present species distribution in the littoral zone of Southern Greenland, an area which represents an important gateway for northern range expansions of temperate spe-cies. This study provides baseline information on abun-dances of macroorganisms in the eulittoral Southern Greenland. This knowledge will pave the way for future studies on the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on these communities. Nine sites, situated at different exposure levels, were investigated. A total of 22 taxa were recorded, suggesting low species richness. Pa-tellid limpets and predators such as dogwhelks, starfish and crabs were absent. Total standing stock ranged from 0 to 31,898 g m -2 . Species composition and biomasses were related to locally generated wave exposure, oceanic swells and ice scouring. The high standing stock at sheltered sites indicated that neither light, temperature nor nutrients, constrained buildup of biomass in this environment. Inshore seasonal measurements of water and air tempera-tures were recorded for the first time in the region, dis-playing low water temperatures and high variation in air temperatures, indicating lack of insulating stable sea ice in the area. Possible impacts of ongoing temperature changes are discussed based on recorded temperatures and meteo-rological data from the past 30 years.},

The present paper describes how the aquaculture waste model DEPOMOD (Cromey, C.J., Nickell, T.D., Black, K.D. 2002a. DEPOMOD - modelling the deposition and biological effects of waste solids from marine cage farms. Aquaculture 214, 211-239.), originally developed for finfish aquaculture sites, was adapted and validated for suspended shellfish aquaculture. Field data were collected for species-specific model input parameters (mussel biodeposition rates and particle settling velocities) and several finfish model parameters (farm representation and calculation of aquaculture wastes) were adjusted for the shellfish scenario. Shellfish-DEPOMOD was tested at three coastal mussel Mytilus edulis farms with differing hydrodynamic regimes in Quebec, Canada. For each site, model predictions were compared to observed deposition measured in situ with sediment traps. Sedimentation rates under the three mussel culture sites were ca. two to five times those observed at corresponding reference sites. Mussel biodeposits were predicted to accumulate within 30??m of the farms in the shallow depositional sites while being dispersed more than 90??m in the deeper dispersive site. At the farm site in Great-Entry Lagoon, model predictions agreed well with field data for the 0 + and 1 + mussel cohorts when the maximum biodeposit production parameter was used. At the farm site in House-Harbour Lagoon, model predictions did not agree with observed sedimentation rates, due most likely to the resuspension and advection of non farm-derived material and complex hydrodynamics. The model correctly predicted the pattern of waste dispersal at the third farm site in Cascapedia Bay, although it underestimated biodeposition. Predicted fluxes may have been underestimated at this site because biodeposits from biofouling communities were not included in the calculation of aquaculture wastes. The relationship between modelled long-term biodeposition and benthic descriptors was assessed for the three farms. Alterations to the benthic community were observed at high biodeposition rates ({\textbackslash}textgreater 15??g m- 2 d- 1). At the most disturbed site, predicted fluxes were best correlated with the Infaunal Trophic Index (ITI) (R = - 0.79, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001), followed by AZTI's marine disturbance index (AMBI) (R = 0.64, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001).

In fact, many more have been published concerning the northern Atlantic areas. A study of the marine fish farm impact of a was carried out to improve knowledge regarding these arguments in the Western Mediterranean. A marine fish farm, with light fish biomass, was selected to evaluate the sensitivity of environmental variables and measure their efficiency over increasing distances. The following environmental parameters were used: hydrodynamic (water current speed and dominant direction in the whole water column) and geochemical (sediment water content, porosity, total volatile substance, sulfide, redox potential, total nitrogen, total and organic carbon, total phosphorous, and total sulphur). The sea current was measured, in the whole water column, with an ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler). Four sampling campaigns were performed in January and July 2001, and in May 2002 and October 2002 according to the different reared biomass. The results showed that the most efficient, practical and sensitive parameters were organic carbon, total carbon, total sulphur, sulfide, potential redox, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. The more detectable effects, highlighted by high levels of organic enrichment, were observed in the stations just beneath the cages; moderate impact was present in the area 50 m around the cages and no disturbance was observed further away from this area. The strong but spatially limited organic enrichment found would seem to suggest that the implementation of best management practices should include fallowing and rotation of sea cages to allow sediment recovery. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event.

	abstract = {The main pathways of sulfide oxidation in marine sediments involve complex interactions of chemical reaction and microbial metabolism. Sulfi de becomes partly oxidized and bound by Fe(III), and the resulting iron-sulfur minerals are transport- ed toward the oxic sediment-water interface by bioturbating and irrigating fauna. Although oxygen is the main oxidant for pyrite or amorphous iron sulfi de, oxidation reactions may also take place with nitrate or manganese oxide. Intermediate oxida- tion products such as elemental sulfur or thiosulfate undergo disproportionation reactions and thereby provide shunts in the sedimentary sulfur cycle. Although of widespread occurrence, chemolithoautotrophic sulfi de oxidizing bacteria, such as Thiobacillus spp. or Thiomicrospira spp., appear to be of minor signifi cance relative to heterotrophic or mixotrophic sulfi de oxidizers of diverse phylogenetic lineages. As a unique group, the large sulfur bacteria of the genera Beggiatoa, Thioploca, and Thiomargarita have developed specialized modes of sulfi de oxidation using nitrate stored in intracellular vacuoles. By commuting between electron acceptor and donor, or by temporally bridging their occurrences in the environment through a great stor- age potential for both nitrate and elemental sulfur, these bacteria compete effi ciently with other microbial pathways of sulfi de oxidation. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction in these bacteria leads preferentially to ammonium rather than to dinitrogen, as in the denitrifying bacteria. Beggiatoa appears to be widely distributed in coastal sediments with a high organic load. In such sediments where Beggiatoa often occurs unnoticed in the anoxic, oxidized zone rather than growing as a visible mat on the sediment surface, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium may dominate over denitrification.},

The elements studied were Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Na, Ca, Sc, Cr, Fe, Co, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Cs and Ce. The variability of element concentrations showed a complicated pattern. Differences between both species and localities were found for most elements. Species differences were found to depend on the locality. In most cases where differences between seaweed species were found, concentrations were lower in A. nodosum than in F. vesiculosus which in turn were lower than in F. distichus. At the outer part of the fjord system concentrations of Na, Br and Cd were considerably higher than in the inner part while concentrations of Ca, Fe, Co, Ce, Sr, Sc and Cu were lower. Pb and Zn concentrations show no consistent geographical pattern. The results from a principal component analysis were difficult to interpret. The possible underlying factors controlling the variability of element concentrations are poorly understood. The influence of seawater on the fjord system and variations in run-off from rivers may account for a significant part of the variability seen for many elements. The concentra-tions of most of the elements, especially the heavy metals, were relatively low compared to other areas in Europe and North America.},

	abstract = {Aquatic sediments represent a possibly significant sink of soluble inorganic elements/pollutants (metals, metalloids and rare earth elements) in ecosystems. Bioturbation/bioirrigation was shown to affect the remobilization of some elements where others seem to be unaffected. In view of these contrasting results, the effect of bioturbation/bioirrigation was examined using the invertebrate Chironomus plumosus in a laboratory experiment for a broad range (18) of elements. The experiments revealed an impact of invertebrate bioturbation/bioirrigation on elemental remobilization depending on chemical characteristics of the element ranging from strong influence to influence only at start when the larvae dig into the sediments. Three different types of remobilization were found: (i) element mobilization highly influenced by bioturbation/bioirrigation (DOC, N, Mg, Ca, Sr, Mo and U), (ii) strong element mobilization by bioturbation/bioirrigation at the start of the experiment when the larvae dig into the sediments and afterwards strong decrease, but to higher levels compared to values of treatments without invertebrate impact (Mn, Ni, As, Cd and Cs), and (iii) strong element mobilization by bioturbation/bioirrigation at start when the larvae dig into the sediments and afterwards strong decrease to levels found in treatments without invertebrate impact (Al, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn and Ce). During the experiment a distinct accumulation of most of the elements in C. plumosus was found, where they were not so much bound to the outer surface of C. plumosus but more within the gut system including food and feces. Hence, bioturbation/bioirrigation is certainly a main process controlling mobilization of elements from sediments. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thus, once the eutrophication process is engaged-that is, high organic matter sedimentation-it may be indirectly favoured by benthic organisms; benthos should always be considered in eutrophication studies, (iii) to evaluate the limits of our observations and data, highlighting the strong need for integrated studies leading to new concepts. Coastal ecosystems and benthic communities are potentially impacted by numerous human activities (demersal fishing, toxic contaminants, aquaculture...); in order to design strategies of ecosystem restoration or rehabilitation, we have to better understand coastal eutrophication and develop tools for quantifying the impacts; in order to achieve this goal, some possible directions proposed are: integrated studies leading to new concepts, model development based on these concepts and finally comparison of various ecosystems on a global scale.},

Both aerobic respiration and denitrification took place in the oxidized surface layer, whereas sulfate reduction was most significant in the deeper, reduced sediment. The low availability of nitrate apparently limited the activity of denitrification during summer to less than 0.2 mmoles NO 3 (-) m(-2) day(-1), whereas activities of 1.0-3.0 mmoles NO 3 (-) m(-2) day(-1) were measured during winter. Sulfate reduction, on the contrary, increased from 2.6-7.6 mmoles SO 4 (2-) m(-2) day(-1) during winter to 9.8-15.1 mmoles SO 4 (2-) m(-2) day(-1) during summer. The aerobic respiration was high during summer, 135-140 mmoles O2 m(-2) day(-1), as compared to estimated winter activities of about 30 mmoles O2 m(-2) day(-1).

	abstract = {Although algal blooms, including those considered toxic or harmful, can be natural phenomena, the nature of the global problenl of harnlful algal blooms (HABs) has expanded both in extent and its public perception over the last several decades. Of concern, especially for resource nlanagers, is the potential relationship between HABs and the accelerated eutrophication of coastal waters fronl hunlan activities. We address current insights into the relationships between HABs and eutrophication, focusing on sources of nutrients, known effects of nutrient loading and reduetion∼ new understanding of pathways of nutrient acquisition among HAB species∼ and relationships between nutrients and toxic algae. Through speeific∼ regional, and global examples of these various relationships, we offer both an assessment of the state of understanding∼ and the uncertainties that require future research efforts. The sources of nutrients poten- tially stimulating algal blooms include sewage, atmospheric deposition∼ groundwater flow, as well as agricultural and aquaculture runoff and discharge. On a global basis, strong correlations have been demonstrated between total phos- phorns inputs and phytoplankton production in freshwaters, and between total nitrogen input and phytoplankton pro- duction in estuarine and nlarine waters. There are also numerous examples in geographic regions ranging fronl the largest and second largest U.S. mainland estuaries (Chesapeake Bay and tile Albemarle-Panllico E.stuarine Systeln), to the Inland Sea of Japan∼ the Black Sea∼ and Chinese coastal waters, where increases in nutrient loading have been linked with the development of large biomass blooms, leading to anoxia and even toxic or harmful impacts on fisheries re- sources∼ ecosystems, and human health or recreation. Many of these regions have witnessed reductions in phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) or HAB incidence when nutrient controls were put in place. Shifts in species composition have often been attributed to changes in nutrient supply ratios∼ primarily N:P or N:Si. Recently this concept has been extended to include organic forms of nutrients, and an elevation in the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC:DON) has been observed during several recent blooms. The physiological strategies by which different groups of species acquire their nutrients have become better understood, and alternate modes of nutrition such as heterotrophy and inLxotrophy are now recognized as common among HAB species. Despite our increased un- derstanding of the pathways by which nutrients are delivered to ecosystems and the pathways by which they are assimilated differentially by different groups of species∼ the relationships between nutrient delivery and the development of blooms and their potential toxicity or harmfulness remain poorly understood. Many factors such as algal species presence/ abundance, degree of flushing or water exchange∼ weather conditions∼ and presence and abundance of grazers contribute to the success of a given species at a given point in time. Similar nutrient loads do not have the same impact in different environments or in the same environment at different points in time. Eutrophication is one of several mechanisms by which harmful algae appear to be increasing in extent and duration in many locations. Although important, it is not the only explanation for blooms or toxic outbreaks. Nutrient enrichment has been strongly linked to stimulation of some harmful species, but for others it has not been an apparent contributing factor. The overall effect of nutrient over- enrichment on harmful algal species is clearly species specific.},

We measured net N2 fluxes, sediment oxygen demand, and fluxes of ammonium and nitrate seasonally from five major estuarine habitats: salt marshes, seagrass beds (SAV), oyster reefs, and intertidal and subtidal flats. Net N2 fluxes ranged from 332 ± 116 μmol N-N2 m−2 h−1 from oyster reef sediments in the summer to −67 ± 4 μmol N-N2 m−2 h−1 from SAV in the winter. Oyster reef sediments had the highest rate of N2 production of all habitats. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was measured during the summer and winter. DNRA was low during the winter and ranged from 4.5 ± 3.0 in subtidal flats to 104 ± 34 μmol 15NH 4 + m−2 h−1 in oyster reefs during the summer. Annual denitrification, accounting for seasonal differences in inundation and light, ranged from 161.1 ± 19.2 mmol N-N2 m−2 year−1 for marsh sediments to 509.9 ± 122.7 mmol N-N2 m−2 year−1 for SAV sediments. Given the current habitat distribution in our study system, an estimated 28.3 × 106 mol of N are removed per year or 76 \% of estimated watershed nitrogen load.

From 1980 to 1996 a total of 50 species were taken. There was a substantial decline in the overall catch per unit of effort (CPUE) during that time. For individual species we observed four general tem-poral patterns: (1) a steady decline throughout the period; (2) high CPUE from 1983 to 1986; (3) variable catches throughout the 1980s but extremely low catches from 1993 to 1996; and (4) variable catches through-out the entire period. Among the several species with particularly large declines were bocaccio (98.7\%), blue rockfish (95.2\%), and olive rockfish (83.0\%)). Three species that were abundant in 1980 were absent by 1996 (chilipepper, swordspine, and yellowtail rockfishes). The number of species caught also decreased during the course of the survey. We analyzed length frequencies for a subset of the species. O n average, mean total length declined. This decline was due mainly to the removal of the larger size classes rather than to increased catches of juveniles. An extreme example was observed for vermilion rock-fish: over the course of the survey, the fishery changed from one comprising primarily adults to almost en-tirely juveniles. We conclude that the declines in rockfish catches in the Southern California Bight between 1980 and 1996 reflect reduced populations. These population declines probably result from poor long-term juvede recruitment, caused by adverse oceanographic conditions, as well as from essentially unregulated overfishing of adults and subadults, perhaps leading to recruitment overfishing.},

Diel variability in the sediment oxygen demand and in the flux of dinitrogen were attributable to the occurrence of benthic photosynthesis. Daytime denitrification rates exceeded nighttime rates. During daytime chamber incubations, small changes in dissolved oxygen concentration were observed. At night, oxygen concentrations decreased, as consumption reactions dominated the oxygen flux. Oxygen production by benthic microalgae enhanced rates of, and coupling between, nitrification and denitrification when ammonium was not limiting, resulting in significant loss of nitrogen from sediments as dinitrogen gas. A transient three box model was used to assess the effect of benthic primary production on sediment nitrogen cycling. Model results demonstrate increased rates of nitrification and denitrification in the presence of benthic photosynthesis and agree well with observed patterns of dissolved dinitrogen- and oxygen-flux data obtained during benthic chamber incubations. When no photosynthesis was permitted during the model runs, rates of nitrification and denitrification decreased significantly. Together, our results suggest that denitrification estimates for shallow estuaries could be underestimated if the influence of benthic primary production on denitrification is not considered.},

The intermittent nature of the addition of organic waste allowed us to monitor decline and recovery of the macrofauna, i.e., harvesting of a cage permitted a period of recovery whilst restocking precipitated a decline. The ABC-method proved to be a sensitive indicator of community health. Under a normal feeding regime the macrofaunal community structure indicated a moderately disturbed condition. Only 7 wk after the cage was harvested, species richness had increased markedly and the community adopted an undisturbed condition. Further improvement was apparent 14 wk post-harvest. Similarly, a decline to a moderately disturbed condition was apparent 7 wk after restocking and species richness had declined. No such changes occurred under a cage which contained fish continuously over the same period.},

	abstract = {The distribution of nitrification potential (NP) with depth in sediment and season was investigated in a shallow sandy sediment (0.5 m water) and a deeper muddy sediment (17m water). In both sediments, nitrifying bacteria were present in the anoxic strata (oxygen penetration was 5 mm below the surface). The NP at 6-8 cm depth in the sediment was 50\% and 10\% of the surface NP at the sandy and muddy sediment, respectively. It is suggested that bioturbation and physical disturbance of the sediment were the most likely reasons for this distribution. The NP increased as sediment temperature decreased. This effect was less marked in the muddy sediment. It is concluded that during the summer, the numbers or specific activity of nitrifying bacteria diminished for the following reasons: There was decreased O2 penetration into the sediment and increased competition for O2 by heterotrophs; there was increased competition for NH4 (+) and there was inhibition by H2S. These effects counteracted the potentially higher growth rates and increased rates of NH4 (+) production at the elevated summer temperatures. The potential nitrification rates in the upper 1 cm, which were measured at 22°C, were converted to calculated rates at the in situ temperature (Q10=2.5) and in situ oxygen penetration. These calculated rates were shown to closely resemble the measured in situ rates of nitrification. The relationship between the in situ rates of nitrification and the nitrification potential is discussed.},

Integrated estimates of denitrification in coastal ecosystems are confounded bymethodological difficulties, a lack of systematic understanding of the effects of changing environmental conditions, and inadequate attention to spatial and temporal variability to provide both seasonal and annual rates. Recent improvements in measurement techniques involving 15N techniques and direct N2 concentration changes appear to provide realistic rates of sed- iment denitrification. Controlling factors in coastal systems include concentrations of water column NO− 3 , overall rates of sediment carbon metabolism, overlying water oxygen concentrations, the depth of oxygen penetration, and the presence/absence of aquatic vegetation and macrofauna. In systems experiencing environmental change, either degradation or improvement, the importance of denitrification can change. With the eutrophication of the Chesapeake Bay, the overall rates of denitrification relative to N loading terms have decreased, with factors such as loss of benthic habitat via anoxia and loss of submerged aquatic vegetation driving such effects.},

	abstract = {Oxidation-reduction reactions are very important in natural water systems. In fact, all aquatic organisms obtain their energy for metabolic processes from redox reactions. Photosynthetic organisms catalytically reduce carbon dioxide to reduced organic matter by trapping light energy, while nonphotosynthetic organisms catalytically decompose the organic products of photosynthesis through energy-yielding redox reactions. Nitrogen, which is one of the major elements in the terrestrial and aquatic environments, circulates by many microbially catalyzed redox reactions. In fact, the only non-redox process in the entire nitrogen cycle is ammonia integration with and liberation from nitrogen-containing organic matter. The movements of many other elements also involve redox reactions, such as carbon, iron, and sulfur (Snoeyink, 1996). Redox potentials (E), like free energy (G), are not absolute. The former are measured with reference to the reduction of hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas at standard state conditions: 25 degrees Celsius (°C), 1 atmospheric pressure, and one unit activity for all species. The potential of this reaction, by convention, is taken as zero. Furthermore, redox potentials are comprised of two parts: the oxidation potential, and the reduction potential. The potential of the overall reaction at the standard state can be shown by the following equation (Snoeyink, 1996): E o = E o ox + E o red Eq. 2-1 where E o ox and E o red are oxidation half reaction and reduction half reaction, respectively. For nonstandard states, the redox potential (E) may be related to standard potential by the Nernst equation (Snoeyink, 1996): E = E o – RT/nF ln Q Eq. 2-2 where R = gas constant T = absolute temperature, o K n = number of electrons involved in the reaction F = the Faraday number Q = the reaction quotient 2 -10},

Changes due to predictable or unpredictable effects may be local or far field.

Far-field and long-term risks such as interactions of escapees with natural stocks and effects of fishing to obtain food for cultured fish are more difficult to predict and quantify. Despite this, scoring methods using single or multiple indicators may be applied to determine the degree of risk associated with all identified potentially negative effects. ERA should be part of an integrated planning approach where aquaculture development occurs within a broad framework to include all development and user groups within the coastal zone. Environmental observations and models can then be combined with effective aquaculture husbandry practices to manage environmental risks from all sources.},

	abstract = {It is generally considered that nitrogen availability is one of the major factors regulating primary production in temperate coastal marine environments. Coastal regions often receive large anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen that cause eutrophication. The impact of these nitrogen additions has a profound effect in estuaries and coastal lagoons where water exchange is limited. Such increased nutrient loading promotes the growth of phytoplankton and fast growing pelagic macroalgae while rooted plants (sea-grasses) and benthic are suppressed due to reduced light availability. This shift from benthic to pelagic primary production introduces large diurnal variations in oxygen concentrations in the water column. In addition oxygen consumption in the surface sediments increases due to the deposition of readily degradable biomass. In this review the physico-chemical and biological factors regulating nitrogen cycling in coastal marine ecosystems are considered in relation to developing effective management programmes to rehabilitate seagrass communities in lagoons currently dominated by pelagic macroalgae and/or cyanobacteria.},

In the first experiment, fish were exposed to chronic, periodic but sublethal levels of hydrogen sulphide (maximally 7.8 μM) over a period of 18 weeks. Regular gill and liver samples were taken and growth determined relative to a control group. The difference in growth rate between treated and control fish was small. Gill damage (clubbing, thickening of the secondary lamellae) peaked between 6 and 8 weeks after initial exposure. Subsequently there was evidence of an adaptive response such that after 16 weeks, gill tissues from exposed fish appeared healthy and normal. Liver damage was progressive. By Week 10 more than 50\% of livers examined showed diffuse hepatic necrosis and diffuse vacuolar degeneration which increased to 80\% by Week 18. In the second experiment, salmon were exposed to one, single, acute but sub-lethal dose (22 μM or 29 μM) of hydrogen sulphide over 20 min. The effect on gills, livers and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was monitored over 14 days. For both concentrations, three salmon were sampled immediately, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 days after treatment. Gill tissues showed fusion of the secondary lamellae and thickening of the primary lamellae. Liver damage became evident 3 days after exposure.

	abstract = {Globally, hypoxic areas ({\textbackslash}textless63 mmol O 2 m -3) in coastal waters are increasing in number and spatial extent. One of the largest coastal hypoxic regions has been observed during the summer in the bottom-water of the Louisiana continental shelf. The shelf receives the sediments, organic matter, and nutrients exported from the Mississippi River watershed, and much of this material is ultimately deposited to the sea floor. Hence, quantifying the rates of sediment-water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), oxygen (O 2), and nutrient fluxes is important for understanding how these processes relate to the development and maintenance of hypoxia. In this study, the sediment-water fluxes of DIC, O 2, nutrients, and N 2 (denitrification) were measured on the Louisiana shelf during six cruises from 2005 to 2007. On each cruise, three to four sites were occupied in or directly adjacent to the region of the shelf that experiences hypoxia. DIC fluxes, a proxy for total sediment respiration, ranged from 7.9 to 21.4 mmol m -2 day -1 but did not vary significantly either spatially or as a function of bottom-water O 2 concentration. Overall, sediment respiration and nutrient flux rates were small in comparison to water-column respiration and phytoplankton nutrient demand. Nitrate fluxes were correlated with bottom-water O 2 concentrations (r = 0.69), and there was evidence that decreasing O 2 concentrations inhibited coupled nitrification-denitrification. Denitrification rates averaged 1.4 mmol N m -2 day -1. Scaled to the area of the shelf, the denitrification sink represented approximately 39\% of the N load from the Mississippi River watershed. The sediment-water fluxes reported from this study add substantial information on the spatial and temporal patterns in carbon, O 2, and nutrient cycling available for the Louisiana continental shelf and, thus, improve the understanding of this system. © 2011 Society of Wetland Scientists (outside the USA).},

	abstract = {The discharge of waste from aquaculture operations can lead to eutrophication and destruction of natural ecosystem in receiving water body. A controlled waste production strategy is necessary to maintain sustainable aquaculture growth into the future. As feed is the major source of waste in aquaculture, the management of aquaculture waste should be approached through diet formulation or feeding strategies. Highly digestible diets have been introduced as a solution to reduce solid waste excretion. Further reductions in solid waste can be achieved through careful selection of feed ingredients and feed processing to improve nutrient availability. An increase in faeces consistency by diet manipulation can improve solid removal efficiency. This condition can reduce the proportion of solids in discharged water in the effluent and also improve farm water quality. A reduction in dissolved nitrogen waste can be achieved by ensuring a balance between protein and energy causing fish to use non-protein sources as energy. Phosphorous waste can be decreased through careful ingredient selection and proper processing to improve digestibility. A proper feed ration and feeding method for each species should be adopted because feed waste constitutes a large part of waste production. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. Source: scopus},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the players and pathways of the global nitrogen cycle has advanced substantially over recent years with discoveries of several new groups of organisms and new types of metabolism. This review focuses on recently discovered processes that add new functionality to the nitrogen cycle and on the organisms that perform these functions. The processes include denitrification and other dissimilatory nitrogen transformations in eukaryotes, anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and anaerobic methane oxidation with nitrite. Of these, anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction by anammox bacteria has been well documented in natural environments and constitutes an important sink for fixed nitrogen. Benthic foraminifera also contribute substantially to denitrification in some sediments, in what potentially represents an ancestral eukaryotic metabolism. The ecophysiology of the novel organisms and their interactions with classical types of nitrogen metabolism are important for understanding the nitrogen cycle and its tight links to the cycling of carbon today, in the past, and in the future.},

	abstract = {Nutrient fluxes to coastal areas have risen in recent decades, leading to widespread hypoxia and other ecological damage, particularly from nitrogen (N). Several factors make N more limiting in estuaries and coastal waters than in lakes: desorption (release) of phosphorus (P) bound to clay as salinity increases, lack of planktonic N fixation in most coastal ecosystems, and flux of relatively P-rich, N-poor waters from coastal oceans into estuaries. During eutrophication, biogeochemical feedbacks further increase the supply of N and P, but decrease availability of silica - conditions that can favor the formation and persistence of harmful algal blooms. Given sufficient N inputs, estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems can be driven to P limitation. This switch contributes to greater far-field N pollution; that is, the N moves further and contributes to eutrophication at greater distances. The physical oceanography (extent of stratification, residence time, and so forth) of coastal systems determines their sensitivity to hypoxia, and recent changes in physics have made some ecosystems more sensitive to hypoxia. Coastal hypoxia contributes to ocean acidification, which harms calcifying organisms such as mollusks and some crustaceans.},

Mean ammonium (NH4+) flux ranged from slight uptake (negative values) to NH4+ production rates of about 300 µmol m-2 h-1 (units used for all N rates) and increased with salinity (p = 0.10). Net nitrate (NO3-) flux (-20 to 32) and net N2 flux (-70 to 100) did not relate to salinity. Mean net N2 flux was positive but near zero, indicating that N2 sources and sinks are nearly balanced. Total denitrification, N fixation, and potential dissimilatory NO3- reduction to NH4+ (DNRA) rates were estimated after inflow water was enriched with 15NO3- (100 µmol L-1). Total denitrification rates ranged from 0 to 90 versus N fixation rates ranging from 0 to 97. Potential DNRA, measured conservatively as 15H accumulation, ranged from 0 to 80 and related significantly to salinity (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). Increases in total NH4+ release after 15NO3- additions were higher but closely related (r = 0.9998) to 15NH4+ accumulation, implying exchange reactions of DNRA-regenerated 15N4+ with sediment-bound 14NH4+. The fate of NO2 was related to salinity, perhaps via sulfide effects on DNRA. Potential DNRA was high in southeastern Corpus Christi Bay in August during hypoxia when the sulfide transition zone was near the sediment surface. Nitrogen fixation and DNRA are important mechanisms that add and retain available N in Texas estuaries.},

	abstract = {Invertebrate animals that live at the bottom of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., benthic macrofauna) are important mediators between nutrients in the water column and microbes in the benthos. The presence of benthic macrofauna stimulates microbial nutrient dynamics through different types of animal–microbe interactions, which potentially affect the trophic status of aquatic ecosystems. This review contrasts three types of animal–microbe interactions in the benthos of aquatic ecosystems: (i) ecosystem engineering, (ii) grazing, and (iii) symbiosis. Their specific contributions to the turnover of fixed nitrogen (mainly nitrate and ammonium) and the emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide are evaluated. Published data indicate that ecosystem engineering by sediment-burrowing macrofauna stimulates benthic nitrification and denitrification, which together allows fixed nitrogen removal. However, the release of ammonium from sediments is enhanced more strongly than the sedimentary uptake of nitrate. Ecosystem engineering by reef-building macrofauna increases nitrogen retention and ammonium concentrations in shallow aquatic ecosystems, but allows organic nitrogen removal through harvesting. Grazing by macrofauna on benthic microbes apparently has small or neutral effects on nitrogen cycling. Animal–microbe symbioses provide abundant and distinct benthic compartments for a multitude of nitrogen-cycle pathways. Recent studies reveal that ecosystem engineering, grazing, and symbioses of benthic macrofauna significantly enhance nitrous oxide emission from shallow aquatic ecosystems. The beneficial effect of benthic macrofauna on fixed nitrogen removal through coupled nitrification–denitrification can thus be offset by the concurrent release of (i) ammonium that stimulates aquatic primary production and (ii) nitrous oxide that contributes to global warming. Overall, benthic macrofauna intensifies the coupling between benthos, pelagial, and atmosphere through enhanced turnover and transport of nitrogen.},

Within an adaptive management framework, a good monitoring program can be used to adjust farm management to avert serious and persistent impacts to the sediment. Macrobenthic community represents a good indicator able to detect environmental effects resulting from organic enrichment and, based on this, was selected to monitor Italian marine fish farms. In order to assess the environmental sediment disturbance resulting from marine aquaculture along the Italian coasts three marine fish farms were considered based on their different environmental features: two located in the Tyrrhenian Sea and one in the Adriatic Sea. The selected cage fish farms produce European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), gilthead sea-bream Sparus aurata (L.) and meagre Argyrosomus regius (A.) The study ranges from 2001 to 2012, at different times in each fish farm, and was planned according to the fattening cycles. The samples for benthic community analyses were collected by means of a van Veen grab in selected stations located from 0 to 1000. m from the sea cages, the farthest as control stations. In total 134 stations were sampled for more of 20,000 individuals belonging to more than 450 species. Data analyses were performed with statistical methods and biotic indices were calculated. The results showed changes in benthic communities at the stations located just beneath the cages and connected with high cultured biomass. The impacted sites showed loss of biodiversity and increase of opportunistic species such as Capitella Sp. I and Nebalia strausi. Changes in the benthic communities were more or less evident in relation to substrata composition, hydrodynamic conditions and cultured biomass. The observed impact was limited to a few tens of meters around the sea cages of all the three studied fish farms.},

	abstract = {Porewater and solid phase geochemical data at two contrasting NE Atlantic stations are reported. Station 10552, on the Cape Verde abyssal plain, is a site of slow pelagic accumulation (ca. 0.4 cm kyr-1). Molecular oxygen is present in the sediment column to at least 2 m, and probably much deeper, labile organic-carbon is almost totally consumed in the upper few centimetres of the sediment. By contrast, at station 10554 on the Madeira abyssal plain, the pelagic sequence has been interrupted by the occasional deposition of organic-rich turbidites. Porewater oxygen and nitrate profiles show that subsurface organic metabolism of the organic-carbon associated with the uppermost turbidite layer is a significant fraction of the overall metabolism in the sediment column. This metabolism occurs at a relatively thin reaction front which progresses deeper into the turbidite with time. This phenomenon exerts a controlling influence on the present nutrient profile and redox succession. In a less extreme form, substrate distributions of this latter type are not uncommon in Atlantic sediments. A model has been developed which is controlled by both oxygen and nitrate data. This model permits a vertical profile of metabolic activity to be derived, and also gives estimates of the reaction rate constants and solid phase mixing rates at these two contrasting stations. About 30\% of the total activity at station 10554 is located within the turbidite at the deepening reaction front; this is a non-steady-state condition. In fact, it is found that the integrated metabolic activity at the two stations is not dissimilar (ca. 1-2 ?? 10-13 moles cm-2 sec-1). The striking differences in redox profile are therefore primarily attributable to differences in the distribution of metabolic activity within the column. ?? 1985.},

Denitrification ranged from 1µmol N m2h1 to 21µmol N m2h1, anammox 0.2µmol N m2h1 to 5.7µmol N m2h1, and oxygen uptake 47µmol O2 m2h1 to 631µmol O2 m2h1. The seasonal patterns under ambient oxygen were correlated with those in the hypoxic treatment\&semi; though, on the whole, the magnitude of flux was different. On average, under hypoxia, both the penetration and consumption of oxygen decreased by 50\%, denitrification increased by 32\%, and anammox remained constant. Anammox accounted for between 10\% and 20\% of the total N2 production, which agrees with expectations for waters of these depths (3080m).

DNRA and denitrification in surface sediments were measured at all sites using whole-core incubations and the isotope pairing technique, which allows distinction between denitrification of water column nitrate and coupled nitrification–denitrification. On the marsh platform, denitrification was also measured at depth in the rhizosphere, using a new approach that combined the push–pull method and the isotope pairing technique. In tidal creek sediments, fertilization increased denitrification of water column nitrate by approximately one order of magnitude, and coupled nitrification– denitrification threefold. Coupled nitrification–denitrification made a significant contribution to the total N2 production in the unfertilized creek but was of minor importance in the fertilized creek due to increased rates of denitrification of water column nitrate. In the surface sediment of the marsh platform, fertilization increased denitrification of water column nitrate by an order of magnitude during inundation of the marsh platform, about 12\% of the day. However, coupled nitrification–denitrification occurring at depth in the rhizosphere was the main denitrification pathway, accounting for more than 50\% of the total N2 production in the fertilized as well as in the reference marsh. DNRA was measured in the surface sediment only, where it was comparable in magnitude to denitrification in the fertilized as well as in the unfertilized marsh.},

Similarly, potential denitrification rates measured during the study were similar in all treatments. Net N2 fluxes, determined from N2:Ar ratios using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer were similar among treatments, despite significantly higher sediment chlorophyll-a content in the juvenile treatment.

The amount and proximate composition of salmonid faeces can be estimated using a mass-balance, nutritional approach. Indigestible components of salmonid diets have the potential to affect faecal 'cohesiveness' or 'stability'. Nutrient content and density of faeces can vary depending on diet and submersion time. Faecal density has a greater influence on settling velocity than faecal size. Published settling velocity data on salmonid faeces are highly variable due to differences in fish size, rearing systems, collection time, water density, methodology, the mass fraction tested and diet. Most faecal settling data used in published salmonid waste dispersal models are rudimentary and recent information suggests that such models are highly sensitive to this input. The design of open-water IMTA systems and estimation of nutrient capture and recovery from co-cultured filter feeders is difficult due to limited information on particle size, digestibility, settleable and non-settleable mass fractions of salmonid faeces at cage environments.

The four fish pens were each representing a specific period in the production cycling. There was a positive linear relationship between the rates of sedimentation inside the fish pens and the sediment oxygen consumption indicating that the benthic processes were controlled by the input of organic matter from fish production. The nutrient fluxes were generally higher inside the fish pens, and nitrate was taken up (1.7-5.8 mmolm-2d-1) whereas ammonium (1-22 mmolm-2d-1) and phosphate (0.2-4.7 mmolm-2d-1) were released from the sediments. The sediments were enriched in organic matter with up to a factor 4 compared to outside. A mass balance for one crop of milkfish was constructed based on production data and on measured fluxes of nutrients in the fish pens to assess the loss of carbon and nutrients to the environment. There was a loss to the surroundings of carbon and nitrogen of 51-68\% of the total input, whereas phosphorus was buried in the sediments inside the fish pens which acted as net sinks of phosphorus. The results obtained suggest that fish pen culture as practiced in the Bolinao area, leads to even greater impacts on benthic carbon and nutrient cycling than those found in suspended cage cultures.

	abstract = {© 2016 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and OceanographyAs bivalve aquaculture expands worldwide, an understanding of its role in nutrient cycling is necessary to ensure ecological sustainability and determine the potential of using bivalves for nutrient mitigation. Whereas several studies, primarily of epifaunal bivalves, have assessed denitrification, few have considered nutrient regeneration processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which competes with denitrification for nitrate and results in nitrogen retention rather than loss. This study compares sediment nitrogen cycling including mineralization, DNRA, and denitrification within U.S. clam aquaculture sediments to nearby uncultivated sediments, seasonally. Clam aquaculture significantly increased sediment ammonium and phosphate effluxes relative to uncultivated sediments. Both DNRA and denitrification were significantly enhanced at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments in July and November, while in May only DNRA was increased. The ratio of DNRA to denitrification was significantly higher at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments, demonstrating that DNRA may be favored due to a ready supply of labile organic carbon relative to nitrate and perhaps sulfidic conditions. Functional gene abundances, nrfA (DNRA) and nirS (denitrification) followed similar patterns to nitrate respiration rates with highest nrfA abundances in the clam sediments and similar nirS abundances across seasons and sediment type. Ultimately clam sediments were found to be a significant source of nutrients to the water column whereas uncultivated sediments retained ammonium produced by microbial mineralization. Thus, clam cultivation may promote local eutrophication (i.e., increased primary production) by facilitating nutrient regeneration and retention of ammonium in the sediments.},

	abstract = {Dissimilatory nitrate reductions and inorganic nitrogen pools in intertidal sediments of Delaware Inlet near Nelson, New Zealand, were studied between March 1981 and January 1982. The acetylene block technique was used in sediment cores to estimate rates of in situ denitrification. In the top 10.5 cm of sediment the denitrification rates were 1.2 to 11.0 mg N m-2d-1 (Juncus maritimus marsh), 1.6 to 7.9 mg N m-2d-1 (sand-flat, colonised by Euglena spp. and Oscillatoria spp.), and 1.2 to 6.0 mg N m-2d-1 (Zostera novazelandica bed). These rates were similar to those obtained in an earlier denitrification study of a Delaware Inlet mudflat. The highest in situ activity varied between the top 1.5 cm (eelgrass bed) and the 6 to 9 cm layer (sand-flat). Denitrification capacities as determined by the acetylene block technique in nitratesaturated sediment slurries generally decreased with depth and were 1943, 163, and 136 mg N m-2d-1, respectively, in the top 10.5 cm of marsh, sandflat and eelgrass bed. A comparison with another study suggested net denitrification, except in the sand-flat during blooms of N-fixing benthic microalgae when these areas are sources of bound N. A combination of the acetylene block technique and 15N techniques in both sediment slurres and intact cores showed that 70 to 95\% of the reduced nitrate was denitrified, with the rest being reduced to ammonium. The inorganic N pool in the top 10.5 cm of the mud-flat ranged from 130 mg N m-2 in autumn to 420 mg N m-2 in spring, and in the sand-flat it ranged from 100 to 287 mg N m-2. Generally, ammonium was the dominant component of this pool. In spring, nitrate concentrations increased, and in the sand-flat it transiently became the major inorganic N species. The ammonium and nitrate profiles suggest an export of inorganic nitrogen from the intertidal sediments. © 1983 Spriger-Verlag.},

	abstract = {As in many regions of the world, marine fishes and invertebrates along the Pacific coast of the United States have long been subjected to overexploitation. Despite this history, however, we lack basic information on the current status of many fishes along this coastline. We used data from a quarter century of fishery-independent, coast-wide trawl surveys to study systematically the demersal fish assemblages along the U.S. Pacific coast. We documented fundamental shifts in this fish assemblage. Average fish size, across a diversity of species, has declined 45\% in 21 years. There have been major shifts in the constituent species of the assemblage, with some species achieving annual population growth rates of {\textbackslash}textgreater10\% and others declining in excess of 10\% per year. Annual rate of change in population size appeared to be a function of life history interacting with fishing pressure. Negative trends in population size were particularly apparent in rockfish (Sebastes spp.). However, across all taxa examined, trends in population size were associated with size of maturity, maximum size, and growth rate. Trends in population size were associated inversely with harvest levels, but stocks that mature late tended to decline faster than would be predicted by catch rates alone. Our results are disquieting because they raise the possibility that fishing-induced phase shifts in fish communities may affect the recovery of fishes, even after the implementation of severe fishing restrictions. Resumen: Como en muchas regiones del mundo, los peces e invertebrados marinos a lo largo de la Costa del Pacífico de los Estados Unidos han sido sujetos a la sobreexplotación. Sin embargo, a pesar de esta historia carecemos de información básica sobre el estado actual de muchos peces a lo largo de esta costa. Utilizamos datos de un cuarto de siglo de muestreos con redes de arrastre, independientes de pesquerías, para estudiar a los ensambles de peces demersales a lo largo de la Costa del Pacífico de E.U.A. Documentamos cambios fundamentales en este ensamble de peces. La talla corporal promedio, de una diversidad de especies, ha declinado 45\% en 21 años. Ha habido cambios mayores en las especies que componen el ensamble, con algunas especies alcanzando tasas de crecimiento poblacional de {\textbackslash}textgreater10\% y otras declinando más de 10\% por año. La tasa anual de cambio en el tamaño poblacional pareció ser una función de la historia de vida interactuando con la presión de pesca. Las tendencias negativas del tamaño poblacional fueron particularmente aparentes en los peces piedra (Sebastes spp.). Sin embargo, en todos los taxa examinados, las tendencias en el tamaño poblacional se asociaron con la talla a la madurez, la talla máxima y el crecimiento poblacional. Las tendencias en el tamaño poblacional se asociaron inversamente con los niveles de explotación, pero las existencias que maduran tardíamente tendieron a declinar más rápidamente que lo predicho sólo por las tasas de captura. Nuestros resultados son inquietantes porque aumentan la posibilidad de que los cambios de fase inducidos por la pesca en las comunidades de peces pueden afectar a la recuperación de los peces, aun después de la implementación de severas restricciones de pesca.},

The development of the mosaic was observed by following recruitment and sur-vival of B. balanoides in denuded patches located at the same tidal level along a 60 m stretch of shore. Barnacle recruitment was least under canopies of F. vesicu-losus and greatest in open areas kept moist at low tide by surf. Barnacle survival after settlement was least under the F. vesiculosus canopy due to the whiplash effect of the algal fronds in the surf and greatest in open areas free from competition from mussels. In open areas, early mortality was correlated with settlement density. In areas of dense settlement (60 spat cm -2) up to 90\% mortality resulted within 5 months from crowding associated with growth. In older individuals crowding produced hummocks of elongated, weakly attached barnacles which were more prone to removal by surf than uncrowded barnacles. Mussels exerted competitive dominance over bar-nacles for space and the presence of mussel beds prevented further barnacle recruit-ment. Mussels suffered extensive mortality during winter storms when surf removed dense mats of weakly attached mussels. The patchy distribution of mussels and bar-nacles results from irregular rock substrata producing numerous environmental patches with respect to wave exposure and drainage at low tide, and from density-dependent mortality of both mussels and barnacles which creates patches of new colonizable space within each environmental patch.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews the factors regulating sediment N-cycling, both in the bulk sediment environment and on a process level. N availability is frequently cited as the factor limiting primary production in marine systems over annual time scales though phosphorus (P), silica (Si) limitation or colimitation by N, P, and/or Si sometimes occur on seasonal time scales. In offshore waters, the presence of bioavailable iron can also regulate primary productivity, particularly that by diatoms. Sediment N pools reflect a balance between inputs (external or internal) and outputs (sedimentation, denitrification (DNF), long-term burial, or export), and this balance is affected by a variety of environmental and physiological factors. Within the sediment, N is cycled primarily by microbially mediated redox reactions between more highly oxidized forms (nitrate, NO3-, or nitrite, NO2-) and more reduced forms (ammonium, NH4-, amino acids, or organic nitrogen compounds). Gaseous products of these redox reactions may include dinitrogen, N2, nitric oxide, NO, and nitrous oxide, N2O. One characteristic of the sediment N-cycle is the coupling between aerobic and anaerobic processes. Another characteristic is that for a given species, for example, NO3-, several competing pathways and potential fates may exist. ?? 2008 Copyright ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved..},

The polychaete Hediste diversicolor was used to simulate macrofauna bioturbation and bioirrigation. H. diversicolor stimulated organic matter (OM) mineralization and nutrient recycling. Muddy sediments had more OM from nature, resulting in higher sulfate reduction rates than sandy sediments. Under low levels of organic enrichment grain size did not have any effect on benthic fluxes (sediment oxygen uptake, total CO2, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate). However, at high levels of organic enrichment, sandy sediments accumulated less OM, less sulfide and less ammonium than muddy sediments, while sediment oxygen uptake and total CO2 showed similar levels between sandy and muddy sediments. Thus, grain size should be considered a key parameter for site selection of fish farming facilities when aiming for a sustainable aquaculture industry.},

Presence of anammox, the anaerobic oxidation of NH4+ to N2 with NO2– results in violation of central assumptions on which the IPT is built. It is shown that anammox activity causes overestimation of the N2 production calculated by the IPT. However, experiments with different additions of 15NO3– will reveal the problems posed by anammox. Two alternative calculation procedures are presented, which enable a more accurate quantification of anammox and denitrification activity in sediments where the processes coexist. One procedure is based on measurements of 15N-N2 production in 15NOx–-amended intact sediment cores and data addressing the contribution of anammox to total N2 production estimated from slurry incubations. The other procedure is based on measurements of 15N2 production in at least two parallel series of sediment cores incubated with different 15NOx– additions. The calculation procedure presented is used on field data from four studies where the IPT was used and the potential anammox rate measured. The IPT overestimated total 14N-N2 production rates by 0\%, 2.5\%, 31\%, and 82\% relative to the revised estimates from the 4 different sites, where anammox accounted for 0\%, 6\%, 18\%, and 69.8\%, respectively, of N2 production. The overestimation of true denitrification was, however, up to several hundred percent. Our analysis suggests however that the IPT does not seriously overestimate N2 production in estuarine sediments because anammox accounts for {\textbackslash}textless6\% of N2 production in such sediments, according to present knowledge.},

This cycling is driven by a number of microbial remineralization reactions, many of which occur across the oxic/anoxic interface near the sediment surface. The presence and activity of large burrowing macrofauna (bioturbators) in the sediment can significantly affect these microbial processes by altering the physicochemical properties of the sediment. For example, the building and irrigation of burrows by bioturbators introduces fresh oxygenated water into deeper sediment layers and allows the exchange of solutes between the sediment and water column. Burrows can effectively extend the oxic/anoxic interface into deeper sediment layers, thus providing a unique environment for nitrogen-cycling microbial communities. Recent studies have shown that the abundance and diversity of micro-organisms can be far greater in burrow wall sediment than in the surrounding surface or subsurface sediment; meanwhile, bioturbated sediment supports higher rates of coupled nitrification-denitrification reactions and increased fluxes of ammonium to the water column. In the present paper we discuss the potential for bioturbation to significantly affect marine nitrogen cycling, as well as the molecular techniques used to study microbial nitrogen cycling communities and directions for future study.},

	abstract = {Denitrification occurs in essentially all river, lake, and coastal marine ecosystems that have been studied. In general, the range ofdenitrification rates measured in coastal marine sediments is greater than that measured in lake or river sediments. In various estuarine and coastal marine sediments, rates commonly range between 50 and 250 pmol N m–:! h-l, with extremes from 0 to 1,067. Rates of denitrification in lake sediments measured at near-ambient conditions range from 2 to 17 1 pmol N m-2 h-l. Denitrification rates in river and stream sediments range from 0 to 345 pmol N m-2 h-l. The higher rates are from systems that receive substantial amounts of anthropogenic nutrient input. In lakes, denitrification also occurs in low oxygen hypolimnetic waters, where rates generally range from 0.2 to 1.9 pmol N liter-' d-l. In lakes where denitrification rates in both the water and sediments have been measured, denitrification is greater in the sediments. The major source of nitrate for denitrification in most river, lake, and coastal marine sediments underlying an aerobic water column is nitrate produced in the sediments, not nitrate diffusing into the sediments from the overlying water. During the mineralization of organic matter in sediments, a major portion of the mineralized nitrogen is lost from the ecosystem via denitrification. In freshwater sediments, denitrification appears to remove a larger percentage of the mineralized nitrogen. N, fluxes accounted for 76-100\% of the sediment-water nitrogen flux in rivers and lakes, but only 15-70\% in estuarine and coastal marine sediments. Benthic N,O fluxes were always small compared to N, fluxes. The loss of nitrogen via denitrification exceeds the input of nitrogen via N, fixation in almost all river, lake, and coastal marine ecosystems in which both processes have been measured. Denitrification is also important relative to other inputs of fixed N in both freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems. In the two rivers where both denitrification measurements and N input data were available, denitrification removed an amount of nitrogen equivalent to 7 and 35\% of the external nitrogen loading. In six lakes and six estuaries where data are available, denitrification is estimated to remove an amount of nitrogen equivalent to between 1 and 36\% of the input to the lakes and between 20 and 50\% of the input to the estuaries.},

Two neighbouring mesotrophic (Ca' Stanga; CS) and hypertrophic (Lago Verde; LV) lakes, which originated from sand and gravel mining, were considered. Lakes are affected by high nitrate loads (0.2-0.7 mM) and different organic loads. Oxygen consumption, dissolved inorganic carbon, methane and nitrogen fluxes, denitrification and DNRA were measured under summer thermal stratification and late winter overturn. Hypolimnetic sediments of CS were a net sink of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (-3.5 to -4.7 mmol m-2 d-1) in both seasons due to high nitrate consumption. On the contrary, LV sediments turned from being a net sink during winter overturn (-3.5 mmol m-2 d-1) to a net source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen under summer conditions (8.1 mmol m-2 d-1), when significant ammonium regeneration was measured at the water-sediment interface. Benthic denitrification (0.7-4.1 mmol m-2 d-1) accounted for up to 84-97\% of total NO3- reduction and from 2 to 30\% of carbon mineralization. It was mainly fuelled by water column nitrate. In CS, denitrification rates were similar in winter and in summer, while in LV summer rates were 4 times lower. DNRA rates were generally low in both lakes (0.07-0.12 mmol m-2 d-1). An appreciable contribution of DNRA was only detected in the more reducing sediments of LV in summer (15\% of total NO3- reduction), while during the same period only 3\% of reduced NO3- was recycled into ammonium in CS. Under summer stratification benthic denitrification was mainly nitrate-limited due to nitrate depletion in hypolimnetic waters and parallel oxygen depletion, hampering nitrification. Organic enrichment and reducing conditions in the hypolimnetic sediment shifted nitrate reduction towards more pronounced DNRA, which resulted in the inorganic nitrogen recycling and retention within the bottom waters. The prevalence of DNRA could favour the accumulation of mineral nitrogen with detrimental effects on ecosystem processes and water quality. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The rapid urbanization, commercio-industrial activities and lack of legislative control around the Tolo catchment produced large quantities of untreated or partially treated municipal sewage, agricultural wastes and cottage industrial effluents which were discharged into Tolo Harbour via rivers and watercourses. Control measures were implemented to reduce the external nutrient loading into the harbour since the early 1980s. Nutrient data for the period 1982 to 1997 were analyzed for temporal trends. Over the period of observation, the total inorganic nitrogen and total phosphorus both show an increasing trend, despite a decade of efforts in reducing nutrient loading. The release rates of potentially mobile nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the sediments collected from Tolo Harbour were determined by N and P release experiments under oxic conditions. The experimental results showed that the sediment released significant amount of nutrients, especially orthophosphates and ammonia nitrogen. The maximum release rates were 15.0 and 206.0 mg/m2/day, respectively. Although the external nutrient loading has been reduced, nutrients could gradually be released back into the water column from the contaminated sediments and delay improvement of the water quality. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To ensure both success and long-term sustainability of providing scallop productions, finding suitable sites is an important step in any aquaculture operation. This study was conducted to identify the most suitable sites for hanging culture of Japanese scallop using geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation models. Remote sensing data (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)) were used to extract most of the parameters. Seven thematic layers were grouped into two basic requisite for scallop aquaculture, namely biophysical (sea temperature, chlorophyll, suspended sediment and bathymetry) and social-infrastructural (distance to town, pier and land-based facilities). A constraint layer was used to exclude the areas from suitability maps that cannot be allowed to develop scallop aquaculture, including harbor, area near town/industrial and river mouth. A series of GIS models was developed to identify the most suitable areas for scallop culture using multi-criteria evaluation known as weighted linear combination. Suitability scores were ranked on a scale from 1 (least suitable) to 8 (most suitable), and about 56\% of the total potential area with bottom depths less than 60??m had the higher scores (scores 7 and 8). These areas were shown to have the optimum condition for scallop culture in this region. The final suitability model outputs were compared with field verification data and found to be consistent. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In incubations with 15NH4+ , immediate production of 14N15N, but not 15N15N, indicated that N2 was produced by the pairing of labeled 15NH4+ with in situ 14NO2- via anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Supporting this finding, we also found anammox-related 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequences similar to those previously known from other marine water columns in which anammox activity was measured. We identified and enumerated anammox bacteria via fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and found ladderane membrane lipids specific to anammox bacteria wherever anammox activity was measured by our isotope tracer method. However, in incubations with 15NO3- or 15NO2- , in which denitrification would have been expected to produce 15N15N by pairing of oxidized 15N ions, 15N15N production was not detected before 24 h, showing that denitrification of fixed N to N2 was not taking place in our samples.

	abstract = {Oceanographers noticed already many years ago that far less ammonium accumulated in anoxic fjords and basins, than would be expected from the stoichiometry of heterotrophic denitrification. It was suggested that this 'missing' ammonium was oxidized with nitrate to free N(2). Since then several other workers have argued based on chemical profiles that ammonium is oxidized anaerobically in oxygen deficient marine sediments and waters with either nitrate or manganese oxides as electron acceptor. While there is as yet no direct evidence for the anaerobic ammonium oxidation with manganese oxides in either sediments or anoxic water columns, more and more evidence is being provided for anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite/nitrate. The first direct evidence for the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium was provided in a waste water bioreactor, where so-called 'anammox' bacteria belonging to the Order Planctomycetales directly oxidize ammonium to N(2) with nitrite as the electron acceptor. Although the anammox process was generally seen as a promising process for waste water treatment. it was believed to be insignificant in the natural environment due to the extremely slow generation times (more than 2 weeks) of the anammox organisms. However, recent studies provide direct evidence for anaerobic oxidation of ammonium by nitrate and/or nitrite in marine sediments, oxygen minimum zones, anoxic fjords and basins as well as Arctic sea ice. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences show that the bacteria involved are closely related to anammox bacteria from waste water bioreactors. The combined biogeochemical and microbiological data available indicates that anammox may contribute significantly to the loss of reactive nitrogen in the ocean.},

	abstract = {The largest zone of anthropogenic bottom water hypoxia in the Western Hemisphere occurs seasonally in the northern Gulf of Mexico between the Mississippi River delta and the coast of eastern Texas. This zone of hypoxia reaches its greatest extent in the summer months and is a consequence of seasonal stratification of the water column combined with the decomposition of organic matter derived from accelerated rates of primary production. This enhanced productivity is driven primarily by the input of inorganic nitrogen from the Mississippi River. There are 3 likely sinks for fixed nitrogen within this zone of hypoxia: sequestration in the sediment, dispersion and dilution into the Gulf of Mexico, and denitrification. We assessed potential denitrification rates at 7 stations in the zone of hypoxia during the summer of 1999. Those data are compared with bottom water nitrate, ammonium and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. No denitrification was observed in the water column. Denitrification potential rates in the surface sediments were unexpectedly low and ranged between 39.8 and 108.1 mumol m(-1) h(-1). The highest rates were observed at stations with bottom water DO concentrations between 1 and 3 mg l(-1). Denitrification activity was significantly lower at stations where DO was lower than 1 mg l(-1) or higher than 3 mg l(-1). Nutrient data for these stations demonstrate that as anoxia is approached, the dominant species of nitrogen shifts from nitrate to ammonium. The shift in nitrogen species suggests competition between microbial populations in the sediment community. The lower denitrification rates at stations with bottom water DO {\textbackslash}textless1 mg l(-1) may be due to nitrate limitation or an increase in the competitive advantage of microorganisms capable of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Suppression of denitrification at low DO by any mechanism will increase the residence time of bioavailable nitrogen. This trend could act as a positive feedback mechanism in the formation of hypoxic bottom waters.},

Details are given of the seasonal and depth distribution of sedimenting material, and its composition for a 1-year period. Differences in the pattern of sedimenting material collected at different depths and in the seasonal patterns of sedimentation at the different stations suggested that, in each case there were differences in the relative importance of detritus from various sources. At all stations, phytoplankton production made a relatively small contribution to the total detritus collected, either directly as dead cells, or indirectly as the faeces of zooplankton organisms. Near the head of Loch Etive there were contributions by filamentous algae and Enteromorpha sp., but a major source of detritus was terrestrial debris, mainly carried into the loch in the waters of the River Etive. In the lower basin of Loch Etive, terrestrial detritus also contributed to the total sedimenting near the surface, but at greater depths much of the material collected in the sedimentation jars probably resulted from short-term resuspension and re-deposition of bottom material, reflecting a net transport of fine sediment from the shallower to the deeper areas of the loch. Secondarily resuspended material was also a major source of material collected in the jars exposed in Loch Creran.},

The degree of organic enrichment, determined using geochemical indicators (total free sulfides (S), redox potentials (EhNHE), water content (WC) and organic matter (OM)), was significantly greater in mussel leases compared to reference sites located both outside lease boundaries and in inlets not used to culture mussel (MANOVA, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Post-hoc tests showed that mean WC and OM, EhNHE potentials and S concentration were all significantly different between lease and reference sites (p ??? 0.009). Temporal changes in organic enrichment conditions were detected by comparing our 2001 data to those previously reported from a 1997 survey of the same sampling sites (MANOVA, p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). This multivariate effect resulted primarily from a 39\% increase in mean S concentration between 1997 and 2001 (p = 0.029). Surface sediment variables at reference sites were similar between years. Benthic conditions were discriminated along an oxic-anoxic enrichment gradient using multidimensional scaling analysis. Mussel lease sites sampled in 1997 were clustered within predefined oxic sediment classifications along with the majority of reference sites, but were grouped farther along the enrichment gradient in 2001. The significant increase in hypoxic and sulfidic sediments within mussel farms between 1997 and 2001 is consistent with the 43\% increase in PEI mussel production-a classic response to excessive organic biodeposition in shallow coastal inlets with relatively low dispersive capacity.

In order to determine preference and inhibition it is necessary to measure uptake of each inorganic nitrogen source alone and in the presence of increasing concentrations of the other nitrogen source. Preference for ammonium uptake is manifested primarily in a higher V sub(max) and lower K sub(s) for ammonium uptake than for nitrate uptake and is accentuated by low light and low nitrogen availability.

Sedimentation, benthic N flux, total oxygen uptake (TOU) and sulfate reduction rate (SRR) were all significantly increased below the mussel lines at all 3 farms. Effects of increased sedimentation rates were revealed by sediment profile imaging and were highest at Stn M2. These effects increased significantly with time of farm operation, indicating the accumulation of organic matter within sediments over time. Furthermore, more total particulate organic N deposited at farm stations was recycled into the water column compared to at reference stations (similar to 45 versus similar to 13\%), indicating an increased release of dissolved inorganic N from sediment below the mussel farms. At one station (M2) with the highest increase in sedimentation rate, denitrification seemed inhibited, while at another station (M3), with a less pronounced increase in sedimentation rate, denitrification was in fact stimulated, accounting for 13\% of total sediment N removal. Calculations based on estimated values of N removal through mussel harvest and direct measurements of N input through changes in sedimentation, N regeneration from sediment to the water column through benthic fluxes and changes in denitrification showed, in all cases, a net removal of N from the system, as only 26 to 40\% of the total amount of harvested N had been added to the sediments during the growth period.},

	abstract = {The flux of nitrogen from land and atmosphere to estuaries and the coastal ocean has increased substantially in recent decades. The observed increase in nitrogen loading is caused by population growth, urbanization, expanding water and sewer infrastructure, fossil fuel combustion and synthetic fertilizer consumption 1,2 . Most of the nitrogen is removed by denitrification in the sedi-ments of estuaries and the continental shelf, leading to a reduction in both cultural eutrophication and nitrogen pollution of the open ocean 3,4 . Nitrogen fixation, however, is thought to be a negligible process in sub-tidal heterotrophic marine systems 5 . Here we report sediment core data from Narragansett Bay, USA, which demonstrate that heterotrophic marine sediments can switch from being a net sink to being a net source of nitrogen. Mesocosm and core incubation experiments, together with a historic data set of mean annual chlorophyll production 6,7 , support the idea that a climate-induced decrease in primary production has led to a decrease in organic matter deposition to the benthos and the observed reversal of the net sediment nitrogen flux. Our results suggest that some estuaries may no longer remove nitrogen from the water column. Instead, nitrogen could be exported to the continental shelf and the open ocean and could shift the effect of anthropogenic nitrogen loading beyond the immediate coastal zone. Climate change has altered the phenology or seasonal sequencing of events in a variety of ecosystems 8,9 . In the marine environment, the timing of phytoplankton production is particularly important because it affects both pelagic and benthic ecology 10,11 . For shallow systems, organic matter deposited to the benthos determines fauna abundance as well as rates of biogeochemical cycling 12,13 . In turn, the fluxes of nutrients off the sediment surface can influence water-column phytoplankton production, especially when pelagic nutrient concentrations are low. The impact of climate change on this benthic–pelagic coupling has previously been unknown. Long-term warming 14,15 has resulted in the loss of the winter– spring diatom bloom in most years and a decrease in mean annual chlorophyll production between the 1970s and 1990s in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island (41.3u N, 071.1u W) 6 . This decrease has continued through 2005 and there is also a marked decrease in summer chloro-phyll concentrations (Fig. 1). The exact mechanism behind this decline is not known, but it is believed to be the result of increased year-round grazing 15 or an increase in cloudy days, which negatively affects the onset of the winter–spring bloom 16 (Supplementary Discussion). Nitrogen inputs have remained constant for the last twenty-five years 17 . Combining the chlorophyll observations with associated Secchi disk data (a proxy for light penetration depth) 18 in a simple empirical model that relates carbon fixation by marine phytoplankton to chlorophyll, optical depth, and surface irradiance 19 suggests that primary production in the mid-bay may have declined by 40\% in the last thirty years. Recent measurements in the bay have also shown a marked decrease in sediment denitrification, sediment oxygen consumption, and in the fluxes of ammonium and phosphate from sediments to the overlying water compared with extensive mea-surements made in the 1970s and 1980s 7 . As in most estuaries, denitrification has traditionally been a dom-inant nitrogen process in the sediments, removing between 15–25\% of the nitrogen load from land and atmosphere to the bay 3,20 . But during the summer of 2006, using the N 2 /Ar technique 21,22 , we observed a dramatic change in the net sediment N 2 flux by mid-bay sediments (Fig. 2). High rates of N-fixation were also found in triplicate cores collected in July and August at three other stations throughout the bay (Table 1). The N-fixation was seasonal, and by mid-September the sediments were once again dominated by denit-rification. These N-fixation rates are remarkable for two reasons. They represent some of the highest rates measured for a marine system 23 , and this is the first demonstration that heterotrophic marine sediments can switch from being a net sink to being a major net source of nitrogen. We hypothesized that the decrease in primary production led to a decrease in organic matter deposition to the benthos and the observed reversal of the net sediment N 2 flux (Supplementary Discussion). We tested this hypothesis using core incubations and nine large (4 m 2) benthic mesocosms containing sediment and associated fauna from mid-bay. The mesocosm experiment was designed to quantify the response of the benthos to different levels of organic deposition. Estimates of the proportion of phytoplankton blooms that fall to the bottom in coastal waters vary widely, with larger values for winter–spring blooms and},

Ammonium fluxes were most highly correlated with salinity and laboratory experiments demonstrated that ammonium fluxes increased when salinity increased. The seasonal pattern of DNRA closely followed salinity. DNRA rates were extremely low in March, less than 0.1 mmol m(-2) day(-1), but increased to 2.0 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in August. In contrast, denitrification rates were inversely related to salinity, ranging from 1 mmol m(-2) day(-1) during the spring and fall to less than 0.2 mmol m(-2) day(-1) in late summer.

	abstract = {Intensive agriculture leads to increased nitrogen fluxes (mostly as nitrate, NO3 -) to aquatic ecosystems, which in turn creates ecological problems, including eutrophication and associated harmful algal blooms. These problems have focused scientific attention on understanding the controls on nitrate reduction processes such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Our objective was to determine the effects of nutrient-tolerant bioturbating invertebrates (tubificid oligochaetes) on nitrogen cycling processes, specifically coupled nitrification-denitrification, net denitrification, DNRA, and biogeochemical fluxes (O2, NO3 -, NH4 +, CO2, N2O, and CH4) in freshwater sediments. A mesocosm experiment determined how tubificid density and increasing NO3 - concentrations (using N15 isotope tracing) interact to affect N cycling processes. At the lowest NO3 - concentration and in the absence of bioturbation, the relative importance of denitrification to DNRA was similar (i.e., 49.6 and 50.4 ± 8.1 \%, respectively). Increasing NO3 - concentrations in the control cores (without fauna) stimulated denitrification, but did not enhance DNRA, which significantly altered the relative importance of denitrification compared to DNRA (94.6 vs. 5.4 ± 0.9 \%, respectively). The presence of tubificid oligochaetes enhanced O2, NO3 -, NH4 + fluxes, greenhouse gas production, and N cycling processes. The relative importance of denitrification to DNRA shifted towards favoring denitrification with both the increase in NO3 - concentrations and the increase of bioturbation activity. Our study highlights that understanding the interactions between nutrient-tolerant bioturbating species and nitrate contamination is important for determining the nitrogen removal capacity of eutrophic freshwater ecosystems. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Water samples were collected within, beside, and at two depths relative to a net-pen and analysed for suspended particulate matter (SPM), major and minor elemental abundance, carbon/nitrogen content, and stable carbon isotopes. Sediment traps were also deployed immediately beside the bottom of the net-pen. The highest mean concentration of SPM (0.6 mg l-1) during the feeding cycle was observed within the central region of the net-pen. Approximately 87\% and 30\% of the mean SPM were observed at depth and beside the net-pen, respectively, suggesting that transport of suspended particulates was predominantly in the vertical direction. Sediment trap deployments revealed that sedimentation fluxes of total SPM, carbon, and nitrogen were higher below the farm than at the control site located 500 m away. Major and minor elemental analyses of feed pellets and sediment trap contents showed that calcium, phosphorus, sulphur, and strontium were removed within the net-pen system. The feed-specific carbon isotope signature (\{delta\}13C=-21.4 to -22.0\{per thousand\}) was not evident in the trap samples deployed beside the bottom of the net-pen (\{delta\}13C=-23.4\{per thousand\}), suggesting the relative absence of feed pellet particles, isotopic alteration through fish assimilation and/or dilution of the isotope signature with other carbon sources. However, a feed-signature was evident in samples collected in the upper water column (depth 5 m), suggesting that \{delta\}13C might serve as a useful tracer of feed particles.},

	abstract = {Introduction Defensive aggregation by Strongylocentrotus droe-bachiensis has been invoked as the fulcrum for the transfor-mation of macroalgal beds into coralline barrens in the northwest Atlantic. We critically examined some of the mechanisms contributing to aggregation behavior by ex-perimentally manipulating sea urchins, purported pred-ators and food during autumn 1983 and spring 1984 both in the laboratory and field. We utilized several approaches to examine a range of sea urchin responses to the presence of food, tethered predators, caged predators, crushed con-specifics in the field and predators in laboratory tanks. Some of the field cages had the property of allowing free passage to sea urchins while retaining lobsters; this allowed distinctions to be made between artifacts caused by cage walls or topographic barriers and unrestricted behavioral responses of sea urchins. The results falsified the hypoth-esis that aggregations of S. droebachiensis are elicited by predators. Except in the presence of algae, sea urchins al-ways avoided decapod predators (but not sea stars) and fled from the vicinity of injured conspecifics. However, avoidance behavior was subordinate to feeding responses, demonstrated by mass migrations of sea urchins into cages (with lobsters) to feed on algae. We reaffirmed by ob-servation and manipulation previous studies which showed that sea urchins aggregate only in the presence of food. Two types of sea urchin groupings were delineated: (1) sur-ficial two dimensional associations, often caused by to-pographic or other features which inhibited dispersal and (2) cohesive three-dimensional aggregations induced by food.},

	abstract = {Tolo Harbour is a large eutrophic land-locked estuarine embayment in Hong Kong. The rapid urbanization, commercio-industrial activities and lack of legislative control around the Tolo catchment produced large quantities of untreated or partially treated municipal sewage, agricultural wastes and cottage industrial effluents which were discharged into Tolo Harbour via rivers and watercourses. Control measures were implemented to reduce the external nutrient loading into the harbour since the early 1980s. Nutrient data for the period 1982 to 1997 were analyzed for temporal trends. Over the period of observation, the total inorganic nitrogen and total phosphorus both show an increasing trend, despite a decade of efforts in reducing nutrient loading. The release rates of potentially mobile nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from the sediments collected from Tolo Harbour were determined by N and P release experiments under oxic conditions. The experimental results showed that the sediment released significant amount of nutrients, especially orthophosphates and ammonia nitrogen. The maximum release rates were 15.0 and 206.0 mg/m2/day, respectively. Although the external nutrient loading has been reduced, nutrients could gradually be released back into the water column from the contaminated sediments and delay improvement of the water quality. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Aquaculture contributed 43 per cent of aquatic animal food for human consumption in 2007 (e.g. fish, crustaceans and molluscs, but excluding mammals, reptiles and aquatic plants) and is expected to grow further to meet the future demand. It is very diverse and, contrary to many per-ceptions, dominated by shellfish and herbivorous and omnivorous pond fish either entirely or partly utilizing natural productivity. The rapid growth in the production of carnivorous species such as salmon, shrimp and catfish has been driven by globalizing trade and favourable economics of larger scale intensive farming. Most aquaculture systems rely on low/uncosted environmental goods and services, so a critical issue for the future is whether these are brought into company accounts and the consequent effects this would have on production economics. Failing that, increased competition for natural resources will force governments to allocate strategically or leave the market to determine their use depending on activities that can extract the highest value. Further uncertainties include the impact of climate change, future fisheries supplies (for competition and feed supply), practical limits in terms of scale and in the economics of integration and the development and acceptability of new bio-engineering technologies. In the medium term, increased output is likely to require expansion in new environments, further intensification and efficiency gains for more sustainable and cost-effective production. The trend towards enhanced intensive systems with key monocultures remains strong and, at least for the foreseeable future, will be a significant contributor to future supplies. Dependence on external feeds (including fish), water and energy are key issues. Some new species will enter production and policies that support the reduction of resource footprints and improve integration could lead to new developments as well as reversing decline in some more traditional systems. 1. THE AQUACULTURE SECTOR: KEY FEATURES AND TRENDS (a) Output, value and regional overview (i) Current status Global aquaculture (figure 1) has grown dramatically over the past 50 years to around 52.5 million tonnes (68.3 million including aquatic plants) in 2008 worth US\$98.5 billion (US\$106 billion including aquatic plants) and accounting for around 50 per cent of the world's fish food supply. Asia dominates this prod-uction, accounting for 89 per cent by volume and 79 per cent by value, with China by far the largest producer (32.7 million tonnes in 2008). The rapid growth in this region has been driven by a variety of factors, including pre-existing aquaculture practices, population and economic growth, relaxed regulatory framework and expanding export opportunities. Aquaculture development in Europe and North America was rapid during the 1980s – 1990s but has since stagnated, probably owing to regulatory restric-tions on sites and other competitive factors, although as markets for fish and seafood they have continued to grow.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food-producing sector in the world. It is developing, expanding and intensifying in almost all regions of the world. The global population is increasing, thus, the demand for aquatic food products is also increasing. Production from capture fisheries has levelled off and most of the main fishing areas have reached their maximum potential. Sustaining fish supplies from capture fisheries will, therefore, not be able to meet the growing global demand for aquatic food and aquaculture is considered to be an oppor- tunity to bridge the supply and demand gap of aquatic food in most regions of the world. However, in our efforts to achieve this potential, the sector will face significant challenges. Key development trends indicate that the sector contin- ues to intensify and diversify and is continuing to use new species and modify its systems and practices. Markets, trade and consumption preferences strongly influence the growth of the sector, with clear demands for the production of safe and quality products. As a consequence, increasing emphasis is placed on enhanced enforcement of regulation and better governance of the sector. It is increasingly realized that sustainable development and responsible production of aquaculture, in the long run, cannot be achieved without the full participa- tion of the producers in the decision-making and regulation process, which has led to efforts to empower farmers and their associations and move toward increasing self-regulation. These factors are all contributing to an improvement in the management of the sector, typically through the promotion of ‘better management' practices of producers. This review discusses the role of aquacul- ture, as at large a small-scale farmer driven production sector, in the quest for sustainable development, reducing poverty and improving food security on a global scale.},

Based on the need to evaluate aquaculture effects over multiple farms, a model was developed to compare the rate of mussel egestion with the scale of culture and tidal flushing of particulate waste from estuarine waters. Egestion was calculated using a bioenergetic submodel, and tidal flushing was determined with a tidal prism method. A short-term field program of particle sensing and sediment trapping was undertaken in Tracadie Bay and Savage Harbour (Prince Edward Island) to examine model assumptions and for validation.

	abstract = {Researchers have recognized growing imbalance between new nitrogen (N) inputs and N losses in the marine environment through human activities, especially in estuarine and coastal waters where N overenrichment has fueled accelerated primary production, or eutrophication, which is an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem. This chapter focuses on this imbalance in organic matter specifically nitrogen and its effects on ecology. From a food web perspective, eutrophication is a condition where nutrient-enhanced primary production exceeds the ability of higher ranked consumers to utilize it. Characterized this condition as "too much of good thing," or overfertilization of N-limited marine ecosystems with new N, the bulk of it being anthropogenic. Symptoms of N-driven eutrophication include: subtle increases in plant production, changes in primary producer community composition, rapidly accelerating algal growth, visible discoloration or blooms, losses in water clarity, and increased consumption of oxygen leading to ecosystem-scale oxygen depletion (hypoxia, anoxia), which is stressful to resident fauna and flora, and can lead to elimination of habitats. Lastly, excessive N enrichment, relative to other nutrient inputs, can alter nutrient input balances and cycling, including shifts to phosphorus and silicon limitation of primary production in receiving estuarine and coastal waters Anthropogenic or cultural eutrophication has been closely linked to population densities in coastal watersheds A significant, and in many instances increasing, proportion of new N input can also be attributed to remote sources delivered through airsheds and subsurface aquifers outside the immediate watershed. © 2008 Copyright © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {This chapter presents new information on the NH3-oxidizing Archaea, which were unknown at the times of the earlier reviews. The most important organisms in aerobic nitrification are nitrifying bacteria and the NH3 oxidizing Archaea (AOA). Until very recently, the known nitrifiers were restricted to the Proteobacterial phylum. There are two functionally distinct groups of nitrifiers: those that oxidize NH4+ to NO2- (NH3-oxidizing bacteria and Archaea, NH3-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and AOA) and those that oxidize nitrite to NO3- (NO2- -oxidizing bacteria, NOB). No organism is known to carry out both reactions. These unique metabolic traits are not without costs; the chemolithoautotrophic lifestyle enables nitrifiers to exploit a unique niche in natural systems, but also confers constraints such as slow growth and inflexible nutritional requirements. A new group of aerobic NO3- oxidizing nitrifiers was recently discovered, first by detection of NH3 oxidizing genes of apparent Archaeal origin in environmental metagenomic libraries and subsequently verified with the cultivation of a strain of Archaea (NH3-oxidizing Archaea, AOA) that oxidizes NH3 to NO2-, apparently using a pathway very much like that known in AOB. It now seems likely that AOA are more abundant than AOB in marine systems, and are also prevalent in soils. ?? 2008 Copyright ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved..},

By influencing the activity of BMA, light regulated the metabolic status of the sediments, and, in turn, exerted strong control on sediment nitrogen dynamics and the fate of inorganic nitrogen. A pulsed addition of 15N-labeled NO3- tracked the effect and fate of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the system. Under illuminated conditions, BMA communities influenced benthic fluxes directly, via DIN uptake, and indirectly, by altering the oxygen penetration depth. Under dark hypoxic and anoxic conditions, the fate of water column NO3- was determined largely by three competing dissimilatory reductive processes; DNF, DNRA, and, on one occasion, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Mass balance of the added 15N tracer illustrated that DNF accounted for a maximum of 48.2\% of the 15NO3- reduced while DNRA (a minimum of 11.4\%) and anammox (a minimum of 2.2\%) accounted for much less. A slurry experiment was employed to further examine the partitioning between DNF and DNRA. High sulfide concentrations negatively impacted rates of both processes, while high DOC:NO3- ratios favored DNRA over DNF. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Site selection is a key factor in any aquaculture operation, affecting both success and sustainability. The correct choice of site in any aquatic farming operation is vitally important since it can greatly influence economic viability by determining capital outlay, and, by affecting running costs, rates of productions and mortality factors. It is impractical to try control water quality parameters in cage culture systems, therefore culture of any species must be established in geographical regions having adequate water quality and exchange. This study used GIS and related technology to build a spatial database using those water quality variables which were considered to have an influence in developing marine fish-cage culture of seabass and seabream in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The water quality variables identified were: temperature, turbidity (runoff soil erosion and sewage), disease stress (sewage) and possibility of waste feedback from fish-cages (bathymetry). Variables were grouped in a logical model and combined to generate outputs showing the most suitable areas for siting cage culture. Most areas of the coastline of Tenerife were identified as being suitable or very suitable, and none was identified as totally unsuitable. Sensitivity to parameter changes was tested in order to evaluate the model, by changing one parameter at a time. Values chosen were ± 5\%, 10\% and 15\% of the reference situation. This analysis shows that the model was especially sensitive to sea temperature and suspended solids. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We studied the initial impact of organic loads due to the biodeposition of a new fish farm in a non-impacted coastal area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Sediment chemistry and meiofaunal assemblages were investigated from July 1997 to February 1998 on a monthly basis at two stations: the first was located under the fish farm, while the second was at about 1 km distance, and served as control. Variations in the biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter and meiofaunal community structure were also related to changes in reared fish biomass. The presence of the cage-induced rapid changes in the benthic compartment: the sediments reached rapidly (i.e., after only 6 weeks) reducing conditions. A significant accumulation of biopolymeric carbon was observed beneath the cage both at the beginning of this study and 5-7 months after cage disposal and appeared to be related to the fish-farm production cycle. Sedimentary proteins and lipids resulted to be good descriptors of medium-term fish-farm impact. Changes in the sediment conditions beneath the cage determined a significant reduction of the total meiofaunal density (on average for 70\%). Most meiofaunal taxa, including nematodes, copepods and ostracods displayed a significant decrease in the farm sediments within 3 months after cage installation. Kinorhynchs appeared extremely sensitive to reducing conditions of the sediments and disappeared almost completely, whereas polychaete densities remained unvaried. After initial impact meiofaunal assemblages responded to organic enrichment recovering, at least partially, their apparent structural characteristics. These data indicate that studies carried out several months after cage deployment might underestimate the actual impact on benthic assemblages. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Denitrification efficiency [DE; (N2 - N/(DIN + N2 - N) 9 100\%)] as an indicator of change associated with nutrient over-enrichment was evaluated for 22 shallow coastal ecosystems in Australia. The rate of carbon decomposition (which can be considered a proxy for carbon loading) is an important control on the efficiency with which coastal sediments in depositional mud basins with low water column nitrate concentrations recycle nitrogen as N2. The relationship between DE and carbon loading is due to changes in carbon and nitrate (NO3) supply associated with sediment biocomplexity. At the DE optimum (500–1,000 lmol m-2 h-1), there is an overlap of aerobic and anaerobic respiration zones (caused primarily by the existence of anaerobic micro-niches within the oxic zone, and oxidized burrow structures penetrating into the anaerobic zone), which enhances denitrification by improving both the organic carbon and nitrate supply to denitrifiers. On either side of the DE optimum zone, there is a reduction in denitrification sites as the sediment loses its three-dimensional complexity. At low organic carbon loadings, a thick oxic zone with low macrofauna biomass exists, resulting in limited anoxic sites for denitrification, and at high carbon loadings, there is a thick anoxic zone and a resultant lack of oxygen for nitrification and associated NO3 production. We propose a trophic scheme for defining critical (sustainable) carbon loading rates and possible thresholds for shallow coastal ecosystems based on the relationship between denitrification efficiency and carbon loading for 17 of the 22 Australian coastal ecosystems. The denitrification efficiency “optimum” occurs between carbon loadings of about 50 and 100 g C m-2 year-1. Coastal managers can use this simple trophic scheme to classify the current state of their shallow coastal ecosystems and for determining what carbon loading rate is necessary to achieve any future state.},

	abstract = {The effects of fish farm activities on sediment biogeochemistry were investigated in Loch Creran (Western Scotland) from March to October 2006. Sediment oxygen uptake rates (SOU) were estimated along an organic matter gradient generated from an Atlantic salmon farm using a combination of in situ techniques: microelectrodes, planar optode and benthic chamber incubations. Sulphide (H2S) and pH distributions in sediment porewater were also measured using in situ microelectrodes, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes were measured in situ using benthic chambers. Relationships between benthic fluxes, vertical distribution of oxidants and reduced compounds in the sediment were examined as well as bacterial abundance and biomass. Seasonal variations in SOU were relatively low and mainly driven by seasonal temperature variations. The effect of the fish farm on sediment oxygen uptake rate was clearly identified by higher total and diffusive oxygen uptake rates (TOU and DOU, respectively) on impacted stations (TOU: 70 ± 25 mmol O2 m-2 day-1; DOU: 70 ± 32 mmol O2 m-2 day-1 recalculated at the summer temperature), compared with the reference station (TOU: 28.3 ± 5.5 mmol O2 m-2 day-1; DOU: 21.5 ± 4.5 mmol O2 m-2 day-1). At the impacted stations, planar optode images displayed high centimetre scale heterogeneity in oxygen distribution underlining the control of oxygen dynamics by small-scale processes. The organic carbon enrichment led to enhanced sulphate reduction as demonstrated by large vertical H2S concentration gradients in the porewater (from 0 to 1,000 lM in the top 3 cm) at the most impacted site. The impact on ecosystem functions such as bioirrigation was evidenced by a decreasing TOU/DOU ratio, from 1.7 in the non-impacted sediments to 1 in the impacted zone. This trend was related to a shift in the macrofaunal assemblage and an increase in sediment bacterial population. The turnover time of the organic load of the sediment was estimated to be over 6 years.},

	abstract = {Fluxes and pathways of silicon in a marine rainbow trout cage farm were studied. The measured fluxes included those carried by fish food, juveniles, harvest, fish loss (death and escape), sedimentation from the cages, and benthic release measured with flux chambers in-situ. Two different types of Si mass balances for the farm were constructed. The mass balance according to the flux method was based on the measured fluxes and constructed for each of two consecutive growing seasons. The mass balance constructed according to the accumulation method was based on the total input and removal of Si to the cages of the farm since it was started, and the recovery of Si in the sediment originating from the farm. In both types of mass balances external input was the major source of Si, contributing a minimum of 55-80\% of the total biogenic silica in the material collected in sediment traps below the farm and of the material accumulated in the farm-derived sediment. The Si removed from the farm with harvest contributed a very small part, ???0.3\%, of the amount of Si supplied to the farm with fish food and juveniles. The loss of Si to the environment was 2.4 kg (1985), 2.5 kg (1986) and 2.5 kg (1980-1986) for each ton of fish produced. On a seasonal basis, about 4.5\% of the sedimented biogenic Si was returned in dissolved form from the sediment to the overlying water. This constituted about 0.3\% of the biogenic Si content in the farm-derived sediment. The flux of reactive silicate from sediment below the fish farm was enhanced about 2.5 times compared to nearby sediments unaffected by the farm. ?? 1994.},

	abstract = {Marine waters are often nitrogen (N) limited. Denitrification, the microbial conver- sion of nitrate to dinitrogen (N2) gas, is responsible for significant N removal from the coastal ocean. In contrast, nitrogen fixation, the microbial transformation of N2 to ammonium, is typically regarded as an inconsequential N source. The imbalance between these 2 processes is responsi- ble, at least in part, for N limitation in the coastal ocean. Organic matter quality and quantity has been shown to determine rates of these critical N cycling processes. We hypothesized that the tim- ing of organic matter deposition to the benthos might also be important in determining which pro- cess dominates. We tested this hypothesis using a coupled biogeochemical-molecular approach. We report directly measured net sediment denitrification rates and corresponding expression of nirS, a gene in the denitrification pathway, with the simultaneous expression of nifH, a gene asso- ciated with nitrogen fixation. The timing of organic matter deposition determined the magnitude of the net sediment N2 fluxes. Highest rates of denitrification occurred soon after deposition, and the lowest rates occurred over 200 d after the last deposition event concomitant with increased nifH expression. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that sulfur and sulfate reducers are responsible for the nitrogen fixation. Globally, warming water temperatures, changes in light, and reduced nutrient loads through management intervention have been linked to decreases and/or altered phenology of water column productivity. Based on a conceptual model developed here, we sug- gest that in these systems, heterotrophic sediment nitrogen fixation may become an important component of the nitrogen budget.},

	abstract = {Biologically enhanced pore water irrigation affects the course of early diagenesis in shallow marine sediments, as illustrated here for the carbonate sediments from North Key Harbor, Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida. Whereas macrofaunal activity at the study site extends approximately 15 cm below the water-sediment interface, measured O-2 microprofiles only show O-2 penetration to depths of a few mm. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by considering the 3-D O-2 distribution in the burrowed sediments. Calculations based on an idealized tube model for burrow irrigation show that measureable O-2 concentrations are limited to the immediate vicinity of burrows. Given the observed burrow density (705 +/- 15 m(-2)), a randomly positioned O-2 microprofile has a high probability ({\textbackslash}textgreater90\%) to fall outside the reach of radial O-2 diffusion from burrows. Hence, the shallow penetration depths recorded at the site do not exclude a much deeper supply of O-2 in the sediment via the burrows. Other characteristic features observed in the upper 15-20 cm of the sediments, in particular, the absence of SO42- depletion and the presence of subsurface maxims in the profiles of NH4+ and TCO2, are also the result of pore water irrigation. These features are reproduced by the multicomponent reactive transport model STEADYSED1. Results of the model simulations indicate that bacterial SO42- reduction is the dominant pathway of organic carbon degradation, but that consumption of SO42- in the sediments is compensated by its enhanced transport by irrigation. Thus, depth profiles of SO42- may be poor indicators of the importance of SO42- reduction in irrigated sediments.},

This corroborates previous theoretical and modeling results. However, parental biomass is a predictor for only 5\% to 15\% of the variance in recruitment, demonstrating the weak predictive power of the stock-recruitment relationship in marine fish populations.

To address these issues, we conducted two 21-day in situ mesocosm (3140 L) experiments to quantify the species- and genus-specific responses of phytoplankton to fertilisation of P-rich lake waters with ammonium (NH(4)(+)), nitrate (NO(3)(-)), and urea ([NH(2)](2)CO). Phytoplankton abundance was estimated using both microscopic enumeration of cell densities and high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of algal pigments. We found that total algal biomass increased 200\% and 350\% following fertilisation with NO(3)(-) and chemically-reduced N (NH(4)(+), urea), respectively, although 144 individual taxa exhibited distinctive responses to N, including compound-specific stimulation (Planktothrix agardhii and NH(4)(+)), increased biomass with chemically-reduced N alone (Scenedesmus spp., Coelastrum astroideum) and no response (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Ceratium hirundinella). Principle components analyses (PCA) captured 53.2-69.9\% of variation in experimental assemblages irrespective of the degree of taxonomic resolution of analysis. PCA of species-level data revealed that congeneric taxa exhibited common responses to fertilisation regimes (e.g., Microcystis aeruginosa, M. flos-aquae, M. botrys), whereas genera within the same division had widely divergent responses to added N (e.g., Anabaena, Planktothrix, Microcystis). Least-squares regression analysis demonstrated that changes in phytoplankton biomass determined by microscopy were correlated significantly (p{\textbackslash}textless0.005) with variations in HPLC-derived concentrations of biomarker pigments (r(2) = 0.13-0.64) from all major algal groups, although HPLC tended to underestimate the relative abundance of cyanobacteria. Together, these findings show that while fertilisation of P-rich lakes with N can increase algal biomass, there is substantial variation in responses of genera and divisions to specific chemical forms of added N.},

	title = {Indicators and thresholds for use in assessing shellfish aquaculture impacts on fish habitat},
	abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this research document is to provide science advice needed to allow DFO Habitat Management to make and justify management decisions related to the potential harmful alteration, disruption and destruction (HADD) of fish habitat by shellfish aquaculture. The overall goal of this exercise and of our recommendations is to promote the avoidance and mitigation of a HADD. Our specific objectives were the following: identify, evaluate and make recommendations regarding a range of quantitative indicators (measures of habitat and ecosystem status) that could be used to monitor for potential shellfish aquaculture effects; and provide science-based decision support for the development of an environmental monitoring framework, based on identification of predetermined impact limits (operational thresholds) intended to trigger management actions. A wide range of ecosystem and habitat status indicators and methodological approaches were identified to support industry management and each was initially screened based on habitat impact predictions and observations. Selected indicators were classified based on associated strengths and weaknesses using predefined criteria, including: availability of operational thresholds; regulatory needs; cultured species; scales of impact addressed; cost/benefit; and the needs of responsive management. A habitat assessment framework is recommended for shellfish aquaculture that addresses the need for a consistent and transparent decision-making approach that is science-based, and reflects both fish habitat and ecosystem concerns. The highly diverse Canadian shellfish aquaculture industry (e.g. species cultured, husbandry method, and stocking density) and regional differences in environmental impact risks (related primarily to geographic and hydrodynamic factors) were identified as important considerations for our evaluation of shellfish aquaculture impact assessment options. Recommendations are made towards establishment of an environmental monitoring framework that incorporates sufficient flexibility to be of use in a wide range of environmental settings and that is both effective and practical for current aquaculture operations that range from less than 0.5 to 500 hectares. A primary recommendation of this report is that habitat assessments could be based on a tiered approach that recognizes that an increased risk to fish habitat requires an increase in monitoring effort. Various levels of monitoring could be triggered based on assessments of environmental sensitivity and risk (e.g. dispersive vs. depositional environment and presence of sensitive habitat), the nature of the operation (e.g. size, species and husbandry), and previous measurement and verification of environmental impacts. Inherent within the recommended framework is that ongoing monitoring programs could be continually adaptive to changes in our state-of-knowledge on potential environmental impacts, indicators and related methodologies. It is important to maintain an ability to add or remove indicators to monitoring programs based on sound science. The recommended multi-tiered impact assessment approach addresses the potential for benthic marine habitat impacts in the immediate vicinity of each shellfish aquaculture lease and it therefore parallels science recommendations for finfish aquaculture monitoring in Canada. Scientifically defensible thresholds are available for benthic biogeochemical indicators (sulfides and redox potential) and these could be used to define the hypotheses that need to be addressed in an operational monitoring program. Effective measures are also available for mitigating benthic organic enrichment impacts, and these can be linked to the operational thresholds incorporated in a responsive management framework. Ecosystem-level interactions with dense shellfish aquaculture populations are more complex than for finfish culture and many potential and observed effects on fish habitat cannot be assessed using only site-specific benthic habitat indicators. Measurements with selected far-field impact indicators are needed under certain conditions to compliment benthic operational monitoring. The inability to fully define quantitative operational thresholds for many valid and highly relevant indicators of habitat and ecosystem status (particularly those describing the structure and dynamics of pelagic habitat), owing to present gaps in our knowledge of ecosystem dynamics, should not preclude their potential use. Surveillance sampling programs based on water column parameters are needed under conditions where environmental impact assessments and ongoing monitoring data indicate a relatively high risk that bay-scale impacts will occur. Of particular importance is the need to assess the impacts of longline mussel culture operations on suspended particle concentrations and distribution and the pelagic food web (micro-flora and fauna) in extensively leased coastal embayments. Industry shellfish stocking information for all farms within a management area is considered fundamental to assessments of shellfish aquaculture impacts on fish habitat. The use of sound science practices is required for the design of monitoring programs (statistically valid sampling approaches) and for the analysis of habitat status indicators and data (e.g. quality assurance/quality control).},

	abstract = {Diets of top predators may be useful indicators to the availability of forage fish in marine ecosystems. Juvenile rockfish (young-of-the-year Sebastes spp.) compose a significant part of the diet for many pred-ators in the central California Current, including chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and sev-eral species of marine birds and mammals. Herein, we develop annual indices of juvenile rockfish relative abundance by collating time series data sets on: (i) the proportion of rockfish in the diet of three species of seabirds breeding on Southeast Farallon Island (1975– 2002); (ii) the number of rockfish in chinook salmon stomachs (1980–99); and (iii) the abundance of rockfish captured in scientific mid-water trawl net surveys (1983–2002). We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to combine indices, and refer to these as 'Multivariate Rockfish Indices' (MRI). Combining time series verifies the patterns shown by each alone and provides a synoptic perspective on juvenile rock-fish relative abundance. The diets of predators with the largest foraging ranges (Common Murre, Uria aalge) and chinook salmon co-varied strongly with the net samples, and appear to be the best indicators. The salmon also sampled species of Sebastes not caught in the nets. The MRI reveals interannual variability in juvenile rockfish abundance, a substantial decline in abundance in the 1990s, and a partial recovery in the early 2000s. Predator-based sampling is a cost-effective enhancement of scientific net sampling.},

	abstract = {Salmon aquaculture discharges organic wastes into the marine environment. Salmon metabolism and the waste discharges add nutrients and organic matter to and remove oxygen from both the water column and sediments. The salmon industry in Southwestern New Brunswick (SWNB) is used to illustrate how waste discharges can be estimated in the absence of detailed information on farm operations. A fish growth model and mass balance calculations are used to estimate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus wastes at the farm scale. Feed nutrition data and environmental measurements are used to partition wastes into fractions, and to estimate the oxygen demand. The predicted demand at the time of maximum discharge is 200 times greater than the oxygen uptake measured in surface sediments at cages, suggesting that most farm wastes are dispersed over wide areas and do not accumulate directly under cages. The number of farmed fish in an inlet is then used to predict total discharges to that inlet. In SWNB, salmon aquaculture is the largest anthropogenic source of organic input to the coastal zone. The significance of the wastes on inlet scales (2–25 km) is evaluated by comparing element fluxes through salmon farms with fluxes due to natural processes: primary production, nutrient regeneration, and community respiration. In intensively farmed bays, fluxes due to salmon farms reach values of 20, 330 and 160\% of those due to natural processes for oxygen, nitrogen and carbon, respectively: significant changes to the ecosystem have occurred in these bays. Spatial scales are critical in describing such impacts: effects will be greater close to the farms, and smaller when averaged over larger areas.},

Rates of NH4+ and Sigma CO2 liberation sediment incubations were used with O2 penetration depths to conclude that O2 respiration accounted for only between 3.6-17.4\% of the total organic carbon oxidation. Dentrification was limited to a narrow zone just below the depth of O2 penetration, and was not a major carbon oxidation pathway. The processes of Fe reduction, Mn reduction and sulfate reduction dominated organic carbon mineralization, but their relative significance varied depending on the sediment. Where high concentrations of Mn-oxide were found (3-4 wt\% Mn), only Mn reduction occurred. With lower Mn oxide concentrations more typical of coastal sediments, Fe reduction and sulfate reduction were most important and of a similar magnitude. Overall, most of the measured O2 flux into the sediment was used to oxidized reduced inorganic species and not organic carbon. We suspect that the importance of O2 respiration in many coastal sediments has been overestimated, whereas metal oxide reduction (both Fe and Mn reduction) has probably been well underestimated.},

	abstract = {Suspension-feeding eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were once abundant in Chesapeake Bay and may then have exerted top-down control on phytoplankton and also reduced turbidities, thereby increasing light available to benthic plants. Alternatively, oysters may have simply recycled inorganic nutrients rapidly back to the water column, with no long-lasting reduction in phytoplankton biomass resulting from oyster feeding activity. To help distinguish between these scenarios, we explored changes in nitrogen fluxes and denitrification in laboratory incubations of sediment cores held under oxic and anoxic conditions in response to loading by pelletized phytoplankton cells, an experimental analog for oyster feces and pseudofeces. When organics were regenerated under aerobic conditions, typical of those associated with oyster habitat, coupled nitrification-denitrification was promoted, resulting in denitrification of similar to20\% of the total added nitrogen. In contrast, under anoxic conditions, typical of current summertime conditions in main-stem Chesapeake Bay where phytoplankton is microbially degraded beneath the pycnocline, nitrogen was released solely as ammonium from the added organics. We postulate that denitrification of particulate nitrogen remaining in oyster feces and pseudofeces may enhance nitrogen removal from estuaries. In aerobic incubations with sufficient light (70 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), a benthic microalgal/cyanobacterial community grew that not only absorbed the inorganic nitrogen released from the added organics but also fixed N-2. This result suggests that an ecosystem dominated by benthic primary production may develop in shallow waters when reduced turbidity associated with bivalve feeding increases light penetration to a level that can sustain benthic microalgal production.},

	abstract = {Coastal hypoxia (defined here as {\textbackslash}textless 1.42 ml L-1; 62.5 mu M; 2 mg L-1, approx. 30\% oxygen saturation) develops seasonally in many estuaries, fjords, and along open coasts as a result of natural upwelling or from anthropogenic eutrophication induced by riverine nutrient inputs. Permanent hypoxia occurs naturally in some isolated seas and marine basins as well as in open slope oxygen minimum zones. Responses of benthos to hypoxia depend on the duration, predictability, and intensity of oxygen depletion and on whether H2S is formed. Under suboxic conditions, large mats of filamentous sulfide oxidizing bacteria cover the seabed and consume sulfide. They are hypothesized to provide a detoxified microhabitat for eukaryotic benthic communities. Calcareous foraminiferans and nematodes are particularly tolerant of low oxygen concentrations and may attain high densities and dominance, often in association with microbial mats. When oxygen is sufficient to support metazoans, small, soft-bodied invertebrates (typically annelids), often with short generation times and elaborate branchial structures, predominate. Large taxa are more sensitive than small taxa to hypoxia. Crustaceans and echinoderms are typically more sensitive to hypoxia, with lower oxygen thresholds, than annelids, sipunculans, molluscs and cnidarians. Mobile fish and shellfish will migrate away from low-oxygen areas. Within a species, early life stages may be more subject to oxygen stress than older life stages. Hypoxia alters both the structure and function of benthic communities, but effects may differ with regional hypoxia history. Human-caused hypoxia is generally linked to eutrophication, and occurs adjacent to watersheds with large populations or agricultural activities. Many occurrences are seasonal, within estuaries, fjords or enclosed seas of the North Atlantic and the NW Pacific Oceans. Benthic faunal responses, elicited at oxygen levels below 2 ml L-1, typically involve avoidance or mortality of large species and elevated abundances of enrichment opportunists, sometimes prior to population crashes. Areas of low oxygen persist seasonally or continuously beneath upwelling regions, associated with the upper parts of oxygen minimum zones (SE Pacific, W Africa, N Indian Ocean). These have a distribution largely distinct from eutrophic areas and support a resident fauna that is adapted to survive and reproduce at oxygen concentrations {\textbackslash}textless 0.5 ml L-1. Under both natural and eutrophication-caused hypoxia there is loss of diversity, through attrition of intolerant species and elevated dominance, as well as reductions in body size. These shifts in species composition and diversity yield altered trophic structure, energy flow pathways, and corresponding ecosystem services such as production, organic matter cycling and organic C burial. Increasingly the influences of nature and humans interact to generate or exacerbate hypoxia. A warmer ocean is more stratified, holds less oxygen, and may experience greater advection of oxygen-poor source waters, making new regions subject to hypoxia. Future understanding of benthic responses to hypoxia must be established in the context of global climate change and other human influences such as overfishing, pollution, disease, habitat loss, and species invasions.},

Denitrification and DNRA were mea- sured by the isotope pairing technique and a 15N technique, respectively. The measurements are the first published data of in sjtu activities in sediment below marine fish farms. Oxygen consumption by the sediment and effluxes of NH,' and pod3- were markedly stimulated by organic matter loading from the overlying fish cages. Denitrification of nitrate from the water column (D,) was only of significance nitrate concentrations. during autumn and winter when runoff from land resulted in high water colun∼n In contrast, coupled nitrification-denitrification (D,) occurred in the sediment throughout the summer, with the rates in the sediment below the fish cages surprisingly being of the same magnitude as those at the reference stations. Competition for inorganic nitrogen from benthic microalgae probably inhib- ited the activity of both nitrifiers and denitrifiers at the reference stations, while a mat of Beggiatoa spp. on the sediment surface below the fish cages in late summer indicated the presence of sulfide in the uppermost layers of the sediment, which almost ceased D,. While DNRA was absent in sediment unaf- fected by the trout farms, it was of quantitative importance in the reduced sediment below the fish cages, DNRA activity being up to 7-fold greater than denitrification activity. The ecological conse- quence of this shift in the relative importance of the processes in response to organic matter loading was a reduced nitrogen removal by denitrification and an increased efflux of NH,' to the water column, resulting in stimulation of pelagic primary production and increased nitrogen retention by the ecosys- tem. The excess nitrogen input to the fjord from the trout farms corresponded to approximately 12 \% of the total nitrogen load from land during the summer months. Only 0.1 \% of this additional nitrogen input was removed by denitrification in the underlying sediments during the fish production season. In general, shallow estuarine ecosystems hosting fish farms may therefore face increasing eutrophication problems due to the direct supply of nutrients in the fish food and to shifts in the dominant microbial processes in the sediment below the fish cages.},

	abstract = {The first special volume of Limnology and Oceanography, published in 1972, focused on whether phosphorus (P) or carbon (C) is the major agent causing eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. Only slight mention was made that estuaries may behave differently from lakes and that nitrogen (N) may cause eutrophication in estuaries. In the following decade, an understanding of eutrophication in estuaries proceeded in relative isolation from the community of scientists studying lakes. National water quality policy in the United States was directed almost solely toward P control for both lakes and estuaries, and similarly, European nations tended to focus on P control in lakes. Although bioassay data indicated N control of eutrophication in estuaries as early as the 1970s, this body of knowledge was treated with skepticism by many freshwater scientists and water-quality managers, because bioassay data in lakes often did not properly indicate the importance of P relative to C in those ecosystems. Hence, the bioassay data in estuaries had little influence on water-quality management. Over the past two decades, a strong consensus has evolved among the scientific community that N is the primary cause of eutrophication in many coastal ecosystems. The development of this consensus was based in part on data from whole-ecosystem studies and on a growing body of evidence that presented convincing mechanistic reasons why the controls of eutrophication in lakes and coastal marine ecosystems may differ. Even though N is probably the major cause of eutrophication in most coastal systems in the temperate zone, optimal management of coastal eutrophication suggests controlling both N and P, in part because P can limit primary production in some systems. In addition, excess P in estuaries can interact with the availability of N and silica (Si) to adversely affect ecological structure. Reduction of P to upstream freshwater ecosystems can also benefit coastal marine ecosystems through mechanisms such as increased Si fluxes. Nitrogen (N) pollution has increased remarkably over the past several decades as a result of increased creation of re-active N for fertilizer use and, inadvertently, from combus-tion of fossil fuels (Galloway et al. 2004). Both a ”white-paper panel” of the Ecological Society of America (Vitousek et al. 1997) and the Coastal Marine Team of the National Climate Change Assessment (Boesch et al. 2000; Scavia et al. 2002) concluded that N pollution is one of the greatest consequences of human-accelerated global change on the coastal oceans of the world. The global distribution of re-active N is far from uniform, and N pollution in coastal waters is greatest where agricultural activity and urbaniza-tion are greatest. In some regions, such as the North Sea and Yellow Sea, human activity probably has increased N fluxes to the coast by a 10-to 15-fold measure or greater, while in other areas, such as Hudson's Bay and Labrador, human ac-tivity probably has had little effect on N fluxes (Howarth 2003). On average for the United States, human activity probably has increased N fluxes to the coast by an estimated sixfold measure (Howarth et al. 2002; Howarth 2003), and some two thirds of the nation's coastal waters are moderately},

This study investigates the existence of positive or negative feedbacks of species that compose the community in intertidal biogenic reefs constructed by the ecosystem engineer Lanice conchilega. This tubeworm creates attractive nursery and feeding grounds for the predatory brown shrimp Crangon crangon, while at the same time is preyed upon by C. crangon. The effect of the predation pressure exerted by C. crangon on the bioirrigation and feeding activity of the tubeworm is up until now unknown and it is hypothesised that these activities are affected by the high densities of C. crangon in the reefs. A mesocosm experiment was set up to investigate the effects of predation pressure on the bioirrigation and feeding activity of L. conchilega in the i) absence; ii) restricted presence; and iii) unrestricted presence of C. crangon. Bioirrigation was quantified by the decrease of an artificially introduced bromide (Br−) tracer, while feeding activity was measured from the incorporation of 13C via stable isotope analysis. The bioirrigation rate of the L. conchilega reef equalled about 30L·m−2·d−1 and was not affected by the presence of the predator. The food uptake of the tubeworm was however about three times lower in the unrestricted presence of C. crangon, presumably due to the retraction of the worm's body and tentacles in its tube induced by physical contact with the predator. Notwithstanding the impacted food uptake of L. conchilega, the tubeworm maintains its functional role in the presence of predators in soft-bottom intertidal areas.},

These naturally occurring disturbances are seldom considered during the assessment of sediment quality. We investigated how the presence (High bioturbation) and absence (Low bioturbation) of a strongly bioturbating amphipod within three different sediments influenced metal bioavailability, survival and bioaccumulation of metals to the bivalve Tellina deltoidalis. The concentrations of dissolved copper decreased and manganese increased with increased bioturbation. For copper a strong correlation was observed between increased bivalve survival (53–100\%) and dissolved concentrations in the overlying water. Increased bioturbation intensity resulted in greater tissue concentrations for chromium and zinc in some test sediments. Overall, the results highlight the strong influence that the natural bioturbation activities from one organism may have on the risk contaminants pose to other organisms within the local environment. The characterisation of field-based exposure conditions concerning the biotic or abiotic resuspension of sediments and the rate of attenuation of released contaminants through dilution or readsorption may enable laboratory-based bioassay designs to be adapted to better match those of the assessed environment.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effects of the burrowing cirratulid polychaete Cirriformia filigera (Delle Chiaje, 1828) on benthic respiration and nitrogen regeneration in metal-contaminated estuarine sediments using laboratory mesocosms. C. filigera is a dominant component of assemblages in the most severely contaminated sediments within the Derwent estuary, southern Australia. In the presence of C. filigera sediment O2 consumption doubled, with approximately 55\% of this increase due to their respiration and the remaining 45\% attributable to oxidation reactions and increased microbial respiration associated with burrow walls. Combined NO3 and NO2 fluxes were unaffected. The addition of labile organic matter did not affect benthic fluxes, in the presence or absence of C. filigera, presumably due to the short timeframe of the experiment and naturally enriched test sediments. The results suggest that a combination of tolerance and burrowing activity enables this species to provide an ecosystem service in the removal of N from contaminated sites.},

	abstract = {The ventilation of burrows by tube-dwelling benthos is understood to be important in determining rates of exchange of solutes between the sediment and overlying water. However, few models have attempted to link the burrow ventilation behavior of tube-dwelling organisms with their geochemical consequences. The classic cylinder model of bioirrigation in muddy sediments (Aller, R.C., 1980. Quantifying solute distributions in the bioturbated zone of marine sediments by defining an average microenvironment. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 44, 1955–1965) links pore-water processes and burrow sizes and distributions in the sediment by assuming that burrows are fully flushed. The equivalence between the cylinder model and the more commonly used one-dimensional non-local exchange model depends upon this assumption. However, this assumption has seldom been tested in the field. We have extended the cylinder model of bioirrigation to include burrow ventilation activities of organisms. Burrow ventilation is modeled as a simple non-local exchange of burrow water with overlying water. Model simulations indicate that burrow ventilation has a large effect on vertical profiles and fluxes of solute tracers. We collected data on burrow geometry in the field by CT-scanning freshly collected sediment cores. At the same study sites, we measured activity profiles of 222Rn, a naturally occurring radionuclide tracer of pore-water transport. With model geometry independently constrained, we tested the model by comparing our model-predicted profiles with measured profiles. Our results demonstrate that burrows in the field are not fully flushed. Our estimated burrow ventilation rates compare favorably with previous laboratory measurements. The inclusion of realistic burrow ventilation in this pore-water transport model strongly affects modeled solute profiles and fluxes. We demonstrate how model parameters can be determined from field samples and present a model that more realistically simulates pore-water transport processes in muddy sediments.},

	abstract = {Porewater profiles and sediment-water fluxes of oxygen, nutrients, pH, calcium, alkalinity, and sulfide were measured in intertidal sandflat sediments from the Oosterschelde mesotidal lagoon (The Netherlands). The influence of bioturbation and bioirrigation by the deep-burrowing polychaete Arenicola marina on the rates and sources of benthic alkalinity generation was examined by comparing measurements in intact and defaunated sediment cores before and after the addition of A. marina in summer and fall 2011. Higher organic matter remineralization rates, shallower O2 penetration, and greater sediment-water solute fluxes were observed in summer, consistent with higher sediment community metabolic rates at a higher temperature. Lugworm activity stimulated porewater exchange (5.1 × in summer, 1.9 × in fall), organic matter remineralization (6.2 × in summer, 1.9 × in fall), aerobic respiration (2.4 × in summer, 2.1 × in fall), alkalinity release (4.7 × in summer, 4.0 × in fall), nutrient regeneration, and iron cycling. The effects of lugworm activity on net sediment-water fluxes were similar but more pronounced in summer than in fall. Alkalinity release in fall was entirely driven by metabolic carbonate dissolution, while this process explained between 22 and 69\% of total alkalinity production in summer, indicating the importance of other processes in this season. By enhancing organic matter remineralization and the reoxidation of reduced metabolites by the sediment microbial community, lugworm activity stimulated the production of dissolved inorganic carbon and metabolic acidity, which in turn enhanced metabolic CaCO3 dissolution efficiency. In summer, evidence of microbial long distance electron transport (LDET) was observed in defaunated sediment. Thus, alkalinity production by net carbonate dissolution was likely supplemented by anaerobic respiration and LDET in summer.},

	abstract = {Nutrient fluxes to coastal areas have risen in recent decades, leading to widespread hypoxia and other ecological damage, particularly from nitrogen (N). Several factors make N more limiting in estuaries and coastal waters than in lakes: desorption (release) of phosphorus (P) bound to clay as salinity increases, lack of planktonic N fixation in most coastal ecosystems, and flux of relatively P-rich, N-poor waters from coastal oceans into estuaries. During eutrophication, biogeochemical feedbacks further increase the supply of N and P, but decrease availability of silica - conditions that can favor the formation and persistence of harmful algal blooms. Given sufficient N inputs, estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems can be driven to P limitation. This switch contributes to greater far-field N pollution; that is, the N moves further and contributes to eutrophication at greater distances. The physical oceanography (extent of stratification, residence time, and so forth) of coastal systems determines their sensitivity to hypoxia, and recent changes in physics have made some ecosystems more sensitive to hypoxia. Coastal hypoxia contributes to ocean acidification, which harms calcifying organisms such as mollusks and some crustaceans.},

The density and composition of epibenthic megafauna and lebensspuren were determined in vertical seafloor photographs during April 1997. Mean eddy-diffusive mixing coefficients according to the distribution of excess 210Pb ( 210Pb-DB) were 0.072±0.028, 0.068±0.055, 0.373±0.119, 0.037±0.009 and 0.079±0.119cm2yr−1 in the northern, western, central, eastern and southern abyssal Arabian sea, respectively. Mean eddy-diffusive mixing coefficients according to the distribution of excess 234Th (234Th-DB) were 0.53, 1.64 and 0.47cm2yr−1 in the northern, western and central abyssal Arabian Sea, respectively. Mobile epibenthic megafauna at the western, northern, central and southern study sites were dominated by ophiuroids, holothurians, ophiuroids and natant decapods (the respective densities were 100, 82, 29 and 6 individuals 1000m−2). The northern study site was characterized by a high abundance of spoke traces and fecal casts. The central site showed spoke traces and many tracks. The southern site displayed the highest abundance of spoke traces, whereas at the western site hardly any lebensspuren were observed. There is evidence for at least two functional endmember communities in the Arabian Sea. In the northwestern Arabian Sea (WAST) vertical particle displacement seems to be dominated by macrofauna and primarily eddy-diffusive. In the southern Arabian Sea (SAST) non-local and `incidental' mixing due to spoke-trace producers might become more important and superimpose reduced eddy-diffusive mixing. With respect to biological data CAST is an intermediate location. Given the biological data, average 210Pb-DB is higher and decimeter-scale variability of 210Pb-DB smaller at CAST than expected. These findings indicate that in a mixture of both endmember communities the organisms may interact in way that increases values of biodiffusivity, as reflected by 210Pb-DB, and reduces decimeter-scale 210Pb-DB heterogeneity in comparison to the simple sum of the isolated effects of the endmembers. For time scales {\textbackslash}textless100years there was no evidence for a relationship between food supply (POC flux) and bioturbation intensity, as reflected by 210Pb-DB and 234Th-DB. Bioturbation intensity should be controlled primarily by the composition of the benthic fauna, its specific adaptation to the environmental setting, and the abundance of each species of the benthic community. Food supply can have only an indirect influence on bioturbation intensity. In certain parts of the ocean the a priori overall positive relationship between POC flux and biodiffusivity might include restricted intervals displaying no or even negative relations.},

The lugworm Arenicola marina is a widespread and dominant large burrower at European Atlantic shores, and a major source of bioturbation and bioirrigation on the extensive intertidal flats in the Wadden Sea (eastern North Sea). The hypothesis that lugworm activities inhibit the successive development from sandy to muddy sediments in depositional embayments has been tested by a large-scale exclusion field experiment. Changes in sediment properties indicate a progressive clogging of interstices with fine particles and organic matter, resulting in lower sediment permeability in exclusion areas compared to lugworm inhabited control areas. Chlorophyll content in the surface layer was consistently higher in the absence of lugworms. Lack of sub-surface irrigation in the absence of lugworms combined with reduced sediment permeability resulted in increased concentrations of ammonium, phosphate, silicate, and sulphide in the pore-water. Concentrations {\textbackslash}textgreater100μM of sulphide gave rise to toxic conditions for macrofauna. The effects of lugworms on sediment characteristics were more conspicuous in fine than in medium sand. It is concluded that A. marina contributes to the maintenance of permeable sand and thereby sustaining suitable conditions for the lugworm population itself. Without this “ecosystem engineer” mud flats would greatly expand at the expense of sand flats in the Wadden Sea.},

There is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal marine ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period as dissolved oxygen. While hypoxic and anoxic environments have existed through geological time, their occurrence in shallow coastal and estuarine areas appears to be increasing, most likely accelerated by human activities. Ecological problems associated with the occurrence of low oxygen are increasing on a global scale. The oxygen budgets of most major estuarine and coastal ecosystems have been adversely affected mainly through the process of eutrophication, which acts as an accelerant or enhancing factor to hypoxia and anoxia, and when coupled with adverse meteorological and hydrodynamic events, hypoxia increases in frequency and severity. The area of hypoxic and anoxic bottom water is even increasing within systems that historically are considered oxygen stressed. Many ecosystems that are now severely stressed by hypoxia appear to be near or at a threshold. Should oxygen concentrations become slightly lower, catastrophic events may overcome the systems and alter the productivity base that leads to fisheries species. Examples of such events are becoming increasingly common. At what point permanent damage will result is difficult to say. To dare there is no large system that has recovered after development of persistent hypoxia or anoxia. The only exception may be small systems where pollution inputs have ceased and recovery initiated from surrounding non-affected areas. The expanding occurrence of hypoxia and anoxia continues to bring about significant structural changes in benthic communities and to affect benthic-pelagic coupling. Restoring ecosystem balance and reversing the trend of increasing hypoxia and anoxia will require dealing with the global problem of coastal eutrophication and determining how to reduce the production of organic matter in sensitive estuarine and coastal areas.},

	abstract = {Bottom trawling causes physical disturbance to sediments particularly in shelf areas. The disturbance due to trawling is most significant in deeper areas with softer sediments where levels of natural disturbance due to wave and tidal action are low. In heavily fished areas, trawls may impact the same area of seabed more than four times per year. A single pass of a beam trawl, the heaviest gear routinely used in shelf sea fisheries, can kill 5–65\% of the resident fauna and mix the top few cm of sediment. We expect that sediment community function, carbon mineralisation and biogeochemical fluxes will be strongly affected by trawling activity because the physical effects of trawling are equivalent to those of an extreme bioturbator, and yet, unlike bioturbating macrofauna, trawling does not directly contribute to community metabolism. We used an existing box-model of a generalised soft sediment system to examine the effects of trawling disturbance on carbon mineralisation and chemical concentrations. We contrasted the effects of a natural scenario, where bioturbation is a function of macrobenthos biomass, with an anthropogenic impact scenario where physical disturbance results from trawling rather than the action of bioturbating macrofauna. Simulation results suggest that the effects of low levels of trawling disturbance will be similar to those of natural bioturbators but that high levels of trawling disturbance prevent the modelled system from reaching equilibrium due to large carbon fluxes between oxic and anoxic carbon compartments. The presence of macrobenthos in the natural disturbance scenario allowed sediment chemical storage and fluxes to reach equilibrium. This is because the macrobenthos are important carbon consumers in the system whose presence reduces the magnitude of available carbon fluxes. In soft sediment systems, where the level physical disturbance due to waves and tides is low, model results suggest that intensive trawling disturbance could cause large fluctuations in benthic chemical fluxes and storage.},

We describe the diversity trends in spatial and temporal gradients affected by fish farming and compare them with those described by the Pearson and Rosenberg model. We found that in general terms, the trends of diversity and other community parameters followed the Pearson and Rosenberg model but they can vary to some extent due to sediment local characteristics or to secondary disturbances. We also show the different mechanisms by which wild fish can affect macrofauna diversity patterns under fish farming influence. In addition, we comment the importance of the macrofauna diversity in the ecosystem functions and propose some guidelines to measure functional diversity related to relevant processes at ecosystem level. We propose more research efforts in the main topics commented in this review to improve management strategies to guarantee a good status of the diversity and ecosystem functioning of sediments influenced by fish farming.},

	abstract = {Between 1994 and 1999, impact on the benthic fauna has been evaluated in two areas with intensive salmon net-pen aquaculture (Lime Kiln Bay, Bliss Harbour). A third embayment (Deadmans Harbour), which lacked significant aquaculture activity, served as a reference site. Changes in benthic community structure were investigated using multivariate, distributional, and univariate analyses. Such changes reflect cumulative stress from various sources, including organic enrichment and chemical therapeutants. Changes at the Deadmans Harbour reference site indicated a general improvement in ecosystem quality during the study period. Lime Kiln Bay experienced an increase in aquaculture activity during the first few years, followed by a complete cessation in 1998. Analyses indicated increased biological stress on the benthic community, suggesting major environmental alterations did take place in that bay. Diversity declined significantly between 1994 and 1995, with a corresponding significant increase in sediment organic content. Analysis of indicator species corroborated the enrichment trend. Sedimentary microbial biomass and organic matter concentrations decreased from 1997 to 1999, reflecting the cessation of fish farming, but the benthos did not recover during this period. It is concluded that benthic impact in Lime Kiln Bay persisted until 1999 even though organic loading decreased. Enrichment levels in Bliss Harbour were elevated from the beginning of the study onwards and the impact persisted throughout the study. The observed differences in community structure within the three embayments were not attributable to differences in sediment types, temperature, salinity, or water depth.},

	abstract = {Denitrification influences the nitrogen budget in estuaries by removing fixed nitrogen from the inorganic pool; rates are dependent on both geological and geographic conditions as well as increasing anthropogenic impacts. In this study the effects of copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), on the denitrification pathway were evaluated in subtidal and intertidal sediments of the Douro River estuary. Dinitrogen, N2O and NO2- production rates were measured in triplicate slurries of field samples under different treatments of metal concentrations. Results demonstrated that similar metal amendments led to different site responses for denitrification, suggesting that variations in sediment properties (metal concentrations, grain size, organic matter content, etc.) and/or differences in denitrifying community tolerance modulate the level of metal toxicity. Denitrifying communities in subtidal muddy sediments were not affected by increasing concentrations of metals. In contrast, intertidal sandy sites revealed high sensitivity to almost all trace metals tested; almost complete inhibition by Cr (95\%) and Cu (85\%) was observed for 98 and 79????g per gram of wet sediment respectively, and by Zn (92\%) at the highest concentration added (490????g per gram of wet sediment). Moreover, the addition of trace metals stimulated N2O and NO2- accumulation in intertidal sandy (Zn, Cu, Cr and Cd) and muddy sediments (Cu and Zn), demonstrating a pronounced inhibitory effect on specific steps within the denitrification enzymatic system. In summary, the results obtained suggest that, according to the type of estuarine sediment, trace metals cannot only reduce total N removal from an estuary via denitrification but also can enhance the release of N2O, a powerful greenhouse gas. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1007/BF02804899},
	abstract = {Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (AD-N) is a significant source of nitrogen enrichment to nitrogen (N)-limited estuarine and coastal waters downwind of anthropogenic emissions. Along the eastern U.S. coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, AD-N currently accounts for 10\% to over 40\% of new N loading to estuaries. Extension of the regional acid deposition model (RADM) to coastal shelf waters indicates that 11, 5.6, and 5.6 kg N ha-1 may be deposited on the continental shelf areas of the northeastern U.S. coast, southeast U.S. coast, and eastern Gulf of Mexico, respectively. AD-N approximates or exceeds riverine N inputs in many coastal regions. From a spatial perspective, AD-N is a unique source of N enrichment to estuarine and coastal waters because, for a receiving water body, the airshed may exceed the watershed by 10-20 fold. AD-N may originate far outside of the currently managed watersheds. AD-N may increase in importance as a new N source by affecting waters downstream of the oligohaline and mesohaline estuarine nutrient filters where large amounts of terrestrially-supplied N are assimilated and denitrified. Regionally and globally, N deposition associated with urbanization (NOx, peroxyacetyl nitrate, or PAN) and agricultural expansion (NH4 + and possibly organic N) has increased in coastal airsheds. Recent growth and intensification of animal (poultry, swine, cattle) operations in the midwest and mid-Atlantic regions have led to increasing amounts of NH4 + emission and deposition, according to a three decadal analysis of the National Acid Deposition Program network. In western Europe, where livestock operations have dominated agricultural production for the better part of this century, NH4 + is the most abundant form of AD-N. AD-N deposition in the U.S. is still dominated by oxides of N (NOx) emitted from fossil fuel combustion; annual NH4 + deposition is increasing, and in some regions is approaching total NO3 - deposition. In receiving estuarine and coastal waters, phytoplankton community structural and functional changes, associated water quality, and trophic and biogeochemical alterations (i.e., algal blooms, hypoxia, food web, and fisheries habitat disruption) are frequent consequences of N-driven eutrophication. Increases in and changing proportions of various new N sources regulate phytoplankton competitive interactions, dominance, and successional patterns. These quantitative and qualitative aspects of AD-N and other atmospheric nutrient sources (e.g., iron) may promote biotic changes now apparent in estuarine and coastal waters, including the proliferation of harmful algal blooms, with cascading impacts on water quality and fisheries.},

	abstract = {Climate change may have differing effects on microbial processes that control coastal N availability. We conducted a microcosm experiment to explore effects of warming and carbon availability on nitrate reduction pathways in marine sediments. Sieved continental shelf sediments were incubated for 12 weeks under aerated seawater amended with nitrate (∼50 μM), at winter (4 °C) or summer (17 °C) temperatures, with or without biweekly particulate organic C additions. Treatments increased diffusive oxygen consumption as expected, with somewhat higher effects of C addition compared to warming. Combined warming and C addition had the strongest effect on nitrate flux across the sediment water interface, with a complete switch early in the experiment from influx to sustained efflux. Supporting this result, vial incubations with added 15N-nitrate indicated that C addition stimulated potential rates of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), but not denitrification. Overall capacity for both denitrification and DNRA was reduced in warmed treatments, possibly reflecting C losses due to increased respiration with warming. Anammox potential rates were much lower than DNRA or denitrification, and were slightly negatively affected by warming or C addition. Overall, results indicate that warming and C addition increased ammonium production through remineralization and possibly DNRA. This stimulated nitrate production through nitrification, but without a comparable increase in nitrate consumption through denitrification. The response to C of potential DNRA rates over denitrification, along with a switch to nitrate efflux, raises the possibility that DNRA is an important and previously overlooked source of internal N cycling in shelf sediments.},

Bacterial biomass was significantly greater in sediments collected from the fish farm sites relative to the controls. This was also true for sediment oxygen consumption (SOC) rates averaged over each 48 h investigation, which were significantly correlated with total benthic (macrofauna and bacteria) biomass. Short-term C-uptake rates by macrofauna were elevated in both fish farm treatments compared with bacterial C uptake and were significantly higher in sediments from the low flow fish farm site relative to both controls. While SOC rates were significantly higher in experiments using sediments from the low flow fish farm site; faunal abundance, biomass uptake, C uptake, bacterial biomass, and metabolism in sediments from both fish farm treatments were not significantly different from one another. Fish farming can dramatically alter benthic ecosystem functioning, and significant effects can occur around fish farms irrespective of the water-flow regime the farms are moored in. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

	abstract = {Experimental and field studies were carried out to characterise biodeposit dynamics in a suspended mussel Mytilus edulis L. farm in Great-Entry Lagoon, eastern Canada. We assessed: (1) the quantity and quality of biodeposits produced by different age classes of mussels, (2) the size-dependent sinking velocity of faeces and (3) the variation in sedimentation rates at different spatial and temporal scales. Individual 0+ mussels produced on average only 63\% of the mass of biodeposits (32.4 mg dry wt d(-1) ind.(-1)) that 1+ mussels did (51.5 mg dry wt d(-1) ind.(-1)). In contrast, the amount of biodeposits produced per unit body weight (dry weight of soft tissue) was greater for 0+ than for 1+ mussels. Faecal pellet sinking velocity ranged from 0.27 to 1.81 cm s(-1) for mussels ranging in size from 3 to 7 cm, and was best correlated with faecal pellet width. Sedimentation rates were greater within the farm than at reference sites, supporting the hypothesis that mussel farming increases sedimentation rates. Variations in sedimentation were also observed at small spatial scales and through time. Prior to the harvesting of 1+ mussels, sedimentation rates directly under the 1+ mussel lines were about twice those 10 m distant, between the lines, and in other zones (reference sites and sites in the lease with 0+ mussels). These observations and sedimentation patterns along transects leading away from the mussel farm suggest that biodeposits from the farm are not dispersed broadly. The estimated initial dispersal of faecal pellets ranges from 0-7.4 m (1+ mussels) to 7-24.4 m (0+ mussels).},

The papers used covered a wide range of farmed species, geographic regions, management practices and specific site characteristics (e.g., depth, exposure, and sediment type). Therefore, the total data-set may not be considered as biased towards a particular set of conditions as is often the case with data collected in a single study. More than 120 biological and geochemical variables were monitored, occasionally using different sampling and analytical protocols for the same variables. The rank correlation analysis between all possible pairs of variables in the data set showed a large number of significant positive or negative correlations, reflecting the response of these variables to benthic organic enrichment. The use of stepwise regression showed that most biological and geochemical variables are determined by a combination of distance from the farm with bottom depth and/or latitude. Results of stepwise regression, repeated separately for each type of sediment, showed that although the general pattern was similar among different types of sediments, the coefficients varied considerably indicating changes of the distance affected by settling particulate organic material for different sediment types. The overall conclusion is that the complicated interactions between variables and the lack of data, such as current speed, induce difficulties in setting common or uniform environmental quality standards for benthic effects of fish farming and these should take into account the existing considerable differences between geographic regions, depth zones and sediment types. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissimilatory nitrate (NO3 -) reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was hypothesized to be a significant mechanism retaining bioreactive N in this warm, saline coastal ecosystem. Nitrogen dynamics, phosphorus (P) fluxes, and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) were measured in northcentral (Rankin Key; eutrophic), north-eastern (Duck Key; high N to P seston ratios), north-western (Murray Key; low N to P ratios), and central (Rabbit Key; typical central site) Florida Bay in August 2004, January 2005, and November 2006. Site water was passed over intact sediment cores, and changes in oxygen (O2), phosphate (o-PO4 3-), ammonium (NH4), NO3, nitrite (NO2), and N2 concentrations were measured, without and with addition of excess NO3 - or NH4 ? to inflow water. These incubations provided estimates of SOD, nutrient fluxes, N2 production, and potential DNRA rates. Denitrification rates were lowest in summer, when SOD was highest. DNRA rates and NH4 fluxes were high in summer at the eutrophic Rankin site, when denitrification rates were low and almost no N2 came from added 15NO3 -. Highest NH4 accumulation, resulting from DNRA, occurred at Rabbit Key during a picocyanobacteria bloom in November. NH4 accumulation rates among the stations correlated with SOD in August and January, but not in November during the algal bloom. These mechanistic results help explain why bioreactive N supply rates are sometimes high in Florida Bay and why denitrification efficiency may decrease with increased NO3 - inputs in sub-tropical coastal environments.},

N cycle pathways (N-fixation, denitrification, anammox, and DNRA) and benthic fluxes were measured at three sites over a year to investigate the hypothesis that DNRA, by producing ammonium (NH4 +) as a dissimilatory end product of NO3 − reduction, was a significant process retaining bioavailable fixed N in Little Lagoon. DNRA was found to be an important NO3 − reduction pathway, especially in the summer months (study average: 52.1 μmol N m−2 h−1) compared to denitrification (study average 7.7 μmol N m−2 h−1). Sulfidic sediments during the majority of the year interfere with denitrification and result in decreased N loss through denitrification. The conversion of NO3 − to the more biologically preferred form of N, NH4 + via DNRA, means that NO3 − reduction has considerable nourishing potential and likely will affect both ecosystem function and services. These results indicate that NO3 − reduction may contribute to, rather than counteract, eutrophication during warm summers in estuaries receiving high N inputs. As estuarine sediments provide a key ecosystem function of N removal, excess anthropogenic N input jeopardizes their ability to effectively remove reactive N in Little Lagoon and likely in other impacted ecosystems.},

While the impacts of trawling on the biomass and community structure of benthic fauna are well known, no existing studies have quantified the effects of trawling disturbance on the absolute production of small benthic infauna. We investigated the effects of beam trawling disturbance on the production of small benthic infauna (AFDM {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.78 to 62.5 mg) at 9 sites that were subject to a 17.5-fold range in annual trawling disturbance, using a size-based approach that could be applied to other soft-bottom systems. We developed a generalised additive model to test for relationships between trawling disturbance and infaunal production and size structure, after accounting for differences in sediment characteristics and depth. The statistical power of our analyses to detect linear and non-linear relationships between production and disturbance, including increased production at intermediate levels of disturbance, was high ({\textbackslash}textgreater90\% probability of detecting a 50\% change in production across the range of disturbance). The analyses showed that trawling frequencies of 0.35 to 6.14 times yr-1 did not have a significant effect on the production of small infauna or polychaetes. This result contrasts with order of magnitude decreases in the production of large infauna, and shows that small polychaetes with fast life histories are less vulnerable to trawling disturbance. Since small infaunal polychaetes are a key source of food for flatfishes, we conclude that beam trawling disturbance does not have a positive or negative effect on their food supply.},

By influencing the activity of BMA, light regulated the metabolic status of the sediments, and, in turn, exerted strong control on sediment nitrogen dynamics and the fate of inorganic nitrogen. A pulsed addition of 15N-labeled NO3- tracked the effect and fate of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the system. Under illuminated conditions, BMA communities influenced benthic fluxes directly, via DIN uptake, and indirectly, by altering the oxygen penetration depth. Under dark hypoxic and anoxic conditions, the fate of water column NO3- was determined largely by three competing dissimilatory reductive processes; DNF, DNRA, and, on one occasion, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Mass balance of the added 15N tracer illustrated that DNF accounted for a maximum of 48.2\% of the 15NO3- reduced while DNRA (a minimum of 11.4\%) and anammox (a minimum of 2.2\%) accounted for much less. A slurry experiment was employed to further examine the partitioning between DNF and DNRA. High sulfide concentrations negatively impacted rates of both processes, while high DOC:NO3- ratios favored DNRA over DNF. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Variation in the spatial and temporal extent of hypoxia in coastal bottom waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico leads to changes in benthic community structure and sediment physical properties. Past and present benthic community structure determines what types of biogenic structures are present in the sediment as well as faunal mixing rates. Therefore, hypoxia has an important effect upon bioturbation. This study focuses upon the effects of hypoxia on bioturbation specifically on the continental shelf of Louisiana, where hypoxia has become an important issue due to its seasonal reoccurrence and increasing expansion across the northern Gulf of Mexico over the past 30 years. In this project, characteristics of biogenic structures in the sediment including number, diameter, and depth are correlated with benthic communities dwelling in hypoxic, intermittently hypoxic, and normoxic conditions using non-destructive Computed Tomography (CT) imagery of sediment cores and Sediment Profile Imaging (SPI) photography. Biogenic structures are also correlated with sediment physical properties, bioturbation rates, and bioturbation behaviors (dilator or compactor) of benthic invertebrate fauna. Initial data for this project was collected during two cruises along the continental shelf of Louisiana, the first in April 2009 and the second in September 2009. Four different "provinces" were chosen for sampling using bottom water oxygen concentration data from the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) and archived sediment type data. These four sampling sites represent normoxic and hypoxic provinces with a consistent sediment type. The provinces consist of a normoxic site (NO) that has experienced hypoxia less than 25\% of the time and briefly hypoxic (BH), frequently hypoxic (FH) and hypoxic (HO) sites that have experienced hypoxia greater than 25\% of the time. We expect areas of rapid deposition (organics and inorganic sediment) and low bottom water oxygen to be colonized by- a few organisms that are concentrated near the sediment-water interface, remaining above the depth of the redox potential discontinuity (RPD). In contrast, well oxygenated areas are expected to have developed diverse benthic communities that have attained the equilibrium stage of succession, which includes larger, deeper burrowing fauna. The diverse, deeper-burrowing benthos helps to create and maintain a deeper RPD. As a consequence of the vertical zonation and faunal diversity differences between stressed and recovered areas, several sediment properties may be affected. SPI photographs show that RPD depths in the four provinces vary from 2 to 6 cm below the sediment surface in the spring, before hypoxia has developed. The x-radiographs depict the extent of recent sedimentation and bioturbation at each province. Featured in the x-radiographs are: event layers, shell fragments, voids above and below event layers, vertical, horizontal, and complex burrows. Preliminary radiochemistry results for the April 2009 cruise indicate shallow depths of sediment mixing at all sites on a temporal scale of ∼1 year (Be-7), though provinces HO and FH show a deeper mixing depth (2.25 cm) over this period than provinces BH or NO (1.25 and 1.75 cm, respectively). This may reflect a competitive advantage of discrete macrobenthic organisms who are better able to tolerate hypoxic conditions, a rapid re-colonization of previously hypoxic bottom sediments, or both. Results from the April 2009 cruise are presented as baseline data to establish benthic macrofauna densities and sediment properties before development of hypoxia. A second cruise was conducted in September to assess the effects of seasonal hypoxia at these same four provinces.},

These oxygen consumption rates are in good agreement with in situ respirometer measurements previously reported for comparable sediments in the north Pacific, but previous estimates based on modeling of pore water nitrate profiles at both sites are two to five times smaller than our minimum fluxes. The differences in oxygen fluxes calculated by the two methods are probably in part due to uncertainty in the assumptions inherent in the nitrate model.

	abstract = {The influences of suspended mussel and infaunal clam cultivation on benthic metabolism and nutrient cycling were compared in Goro lagoon, Italy. Both aquaculture types stimulated benthic metabolism, with sediment oxygen demand (SOD), CO2 and ammonium effluxes of up to 14, 16 and 1.2 mmol m-2 h-1. However, whilst mussel farming preferentially stimulated anaerobic metabolism and sediment reduction, clam farming did not. The mussel ropes were also large oxygen sinks and ammonium sources, with oxygen consumption and ammonium production rates of 1.4 to 1.5 and 0.18 to 0.43 mmol kg-1 h-1. Consequently, the overall impacts of mussel farming on oxygen and nutrient dynamics were much greater than those of clam farming. There were also differences in nitrate-reduction processes and the nitrate sources that fuelled them. In winter, at high water column nitrate concentrations, highest nitrate reduction rates (∼320 mmol m-2 h-1) occurred at the mussel farm. Nitrate reduction was driven predominantly by water column nitrate and ∼30\% of nitrate reduced was recycled to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). At the control and clam farm sites, nitrate reduction rates were lower (∼180 mmol m-2 h-1), nitrification supplied ∼30\% of nitrate and denitrification was dominant. In summer under low nitrate conditions, nitrate reduction was highest (∼130 mmol m-2 h-1) at the mussel farm site, but this activity was completely dependent upon water column nitrate and 95\% of nitrate was reduced via DNRA. In contrast, at the clam farm station, DNRA was unimportant and nitrification was the major nitrate source for denitrification. Consequently, whilst nitrate reduction processes eliminated fixed N from the clam farm sediments via coupled nitrification-denitrification, the dominance of DNRA at the mussel farm site resulted in a net N input to the sediment compartment. These large differences in the impacts of clam and mussel farming can be explained by the fact that infaunal clams stimulate transfer of both organic matter and oxygen to the sediment, whereas suspended mussels enhance only organic matter inputs.},

The inflowing water contained NO(3), and by determination of the isotopic composition of the N(2), NO(3), and NH(4) pools in the outflowing water, it was possible to quantify the following reactions: total NO(3) uptake, denitrification based on NO(3) from the overlying water, nitrification, coupled nitrification-denitrification, and N mineralization. In sediment cores from both lake and estuarine environments, benthic microphytes assimilated NO(3) and NH(4) for a period of 25 to 60 h after darkening. Under steady-state conditions in the dark, denitrification of NO(3) originating from the overlying water accounted for 91 to 171 mumol m h in the lake sediments and for 131 to 182 mumol m h in the estuarine sediments, corresponding to approximately 100\% of the total NO(3) uptake for both sediments. It seems that high NO(3) uptake by benthic microphytes in the initial dark period may have been misinterpreted in earlier investigations as dissimilatory reduction to ammonium. The rates of coupled nitrification-denitrification within the sediments contributed to 10\% of the total denitrification at steady state in the dark, and total nitrification was only twice as high as the coupled process.},

Microprofiles of nitrate reduction pathways in intact cores using diffusive equilibrium in thin layer (DET) gels showed significant rates of DNRA only occurred under oxic conditions in the presence of Fe2+. Cores incubated anoxically, developed free sulfide within the porewater, had very low concentrations of Fe2+ and low rates of DNRA. Slurry incubations with varying concentrations of NO3− showed that denitrifying bacteria had a higher affinity than nitrate ammonifying bacteria with Km values of 49 and 86μmolL−1 for denitrification and DNRA, respectively, however, this could not explain the change in the rates of DNRA relative to denitrification observed. Further slurry incubations to investigate the relationship between DNRA and Fe2+ oxidation were inconclusive and complicated by very high backgrounds of sorbed (HCl extractable) Fe2+. Addition of Fe2+ to the slurry did not stimulate denitrification compared to a control (no Fe2+ addition), however, there was a significant decrease in the Fe2+ concentration over the period where DNRA occurred in the Fe2+ addition treatment, and no significant decrease in the control treatment. The ratio of DNRA to Fe2+ consumption was 15±6 and 7±3 for the Fe2+ and control treatments, respectively. We suggest reduced rates of DNRA under anoxic conditions can be explained by the binding of Fe2+ with free sulfides and the formation of FeS removing available Fe2+ for DNRA.},

In the midel, the microbial community is represented as a distributed metabolic network. Biogeochemical pathways are controlled through the synthesis and allocation of biological structure that serves to catalyze each process. Allocation is determined by way of a thermodynamically constrained optimization according to the principle of maximum entropy production (MEP). According to the MEP principle, ecosystems will organize so as to maximize the dissipation of free energy based upon the available resources (nutrients and electron donors and acceptore). In the model, 3 nitrate reduction pathways, viz. heterotrophic denitrification, anamox, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, compete for electrom acceptors (nitrate and nitrite). The model predicts switches in the dominant nitrate cycling pathways based upon the ratio of carbon to nitrate supply. An advantage of this approach over a traditional organism-centric kinetic approach is that the Monod growth parameters, maximum uptake rate (vmax), and half saturation (km) constants are determined during the optimization proceture as opposed to parameters specified a priori. Such a model is therefore useful for applications where these kinetic parameters are unkown and difficult to measure, such as the marine subsurface, or when ecosystems undergo large-scale environmental perturbations resulting in shifts in the dominant organisms.},

We examined the composition, diversity, abundance and activities of DNRA communities at five sites along a salinity gradient in the New River Estuary, North Carolina, USA, a shallow temporal/lagoonal estuarine system. Sediment slurry incubation experiments with 15N-nitrate were conducted to measure potential DNRA rates, while the abundance of DNRA communities was calculated using quantitative PCR of nrfA genes encoding cytochrome C nitrite reductase, commonly found in DNRA bacteria. A pyrosequencing method targeting nrfA genes was developed using an Ion Torrent sequencer to examine the diversity and composition of DNRA communities within the estuarine sediment community. We found higher levels of nrfA gene abundance and DNRA activities in sediments with higher percent organic content. Pyrosequencing analysis of nrfA genes revealed spatial variation of DNRA communities along the salinity gradient of the New River Estuary. Percent abundance of dominant populations was found to have significant influence on overall activities of DNRA communities. Abundance of dominant DNRA bacteria and organic carbon availability are important regulators of DNRA activities in the eutrophic New River Estuary.},

	abstract = {A database containing published rates of sediment and pore-water transport and biogeochemical transformations has been established to derive empirical predictive equations to calibrate and parameterize global diagenetic models. Rates of sediment accumulation, organic carbon burial, organic matter decomposition via aerobic and anaerobic pathways and bioturbation (in terms of bioturbation coefficients) can be predicted quite well using exponential relationships with water depth as an independent variable. The relationships are corrected for skewhess to reduce the bias inherent in the back transformation from a lognormal to an arithmetic estimate. Bioturbation is shown to be the dominant mode of sediment transport in the upper centimeters of oceanic sediments. The derived empirical relationships are combined with bathymetric maps to estimate globally integrated rates of benthic processes. Ocean margin sediments account for about 85\% of the materials accumulating in the ocean and about 80-90\% of the mineralization in marine sediments.},

	abstract = {Benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, oxygen, nutrients, nitrous oxide and methane were measured in situ at three sites of Río San Pedro salt marsh tidal creek (Bay of Cádiz, SW Spain) during three seasons. This system is affected by the discharges of organic carbon and nutrients from the surrounding aquaculture installations. Sediment oxygen uptake rates and inorganic carbon fluxes ranged respectively from 16 to 79 mmol O2 m−2 d−1 and from 48 to 146 mmol C m−2 d−1. Benthic alkalinity fluxes were corrected for the influence of NH4+ and NO3−+NO2− fluxes, and the upper and lower limits for carbon oxidation rates were inferred by considering two possible scenarios: maximum and minimum contribution of CaCO3 dissolution to corrected alkalinity fluxes. Average Cox rates were in all cases within ±25\% of the upper and lower limits and ranged from 40 to 122 mmol C m−2 d−1. Whereas carbon mineralization did not show significant differences among the sites, Cox rates varied seasonally and were correlated with temperature (r2=0.72). During winter and spring denitrification was estimated to account for an average loss of 46\% and 75\%, respectively, of the potentially recyclable N, whereas during the summer no net removal was observed. A possible shift from denitrification to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) during this period is argued. Dissolved CH4 and N2O fluxes ranged from 5.7 to 47 μmol CH4 m−2 d−1 and 4.3 to 49 μmol N–N2O m−2 d−1, respectively, and represented in all cases a small fraction of total inorganic C and N flux. Overall, about 60\% of the total particulate organic matter that is discharged into the creek by the main fish farm facility is estimated to degrade in the sediments, resulting in a significant input of nutrients to the system.},

	abstract = {Variation in the spatial and temporal extent of hypoxia in coastal bottom waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico leads to changes in benthic community structure and sediment physical properties. Past and present benthic community structure determines what types of biogenic structures are present in the sediment as well as faunal mixing rates. Therefore, hypoxia has an important effect upon bioturbation. This study focuses upon the effects of hypoxia on bioturbation specifically on the continental shelf of Louisiana, where hypoxia has become an important issue due to its seasonal reoccurrence and increasing expansion across the northern Gulf of Mexico over the past 30 years. In this project, characteristics of biogenic structures in the sediment including number, diameter, and depth are correlated with benthic communities dwelling in hypoxic, intermittently hypoxic, and normoxic conditions using non-destructive Computed Tomography (CT) imagery of sediment cores and Sediment Profile Imaging (SPI) photography. Biogenic structures are also correlated with sediment physical properties, bioturbation rates, and bioturbation behaviors (dilator or compactor) of benthic invertebrate fauna. Initial data for this project was collected during two cruises along the continental shelf of Louisiana, the first in April 2009 and the second in September 2009. Four different provinces were chosen for sampling using bottom water oxygen concentration data from the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) and archived sediment type data. These four sampling sites represent normoxic and hypoxic provinces with a consistent sediment type. The provinces consist of a normoxic site (NO) that has experienced hypoxia less than 25\% of the time and briefly hypoxic (BH), frequently hypoxic (FH) and hypoxic (HO) sites that have experienced hypoxia greater than 25\% of the time.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a two-year study of spatial and temporal patterns and processes in the benthos in response to the removal of salmon cages from a sheltered coastal embayment, coupled with the simultaneous reintroduction of cages at an adjacent location. Significant recovery was evident at the fallowed site in the first six months; however, the macrofaunal assemblage remained impacted at the conclusion of the study. By comparison, the reintroduction of a fully operational farm overwhelmed the macrobenthic community within three months, with anoxic and near-azoic conditions developing. Both removal and reintroduction of the farms triggered alternating oscillations of geochemical and biological variables, which were attributed to effects on sediment chemistry from organic loading, ‘boom and bust' cycles of opportunistic taxa in response to food supply, and the associated variations in metabolic potential. The study also revealed interesting spatial dynamics in the benthos and some useful indicators of different stages of recovery and re-impact. It is concluded that farm reintroductions should aim to gradually increase production; allowing time for the benthos to adapt to the additional organic flux, and be maintained at a level that avoids macrofaunal collapse. The sediment's ability to cope with organic inputs from fish farming, and hence the duration of the recovery period, is contingent on the organic load in each farming cycle and the extent to which the sediment community is allowed to recover. Understanding the influence of each of these on sediment processes is important for sustainable long-term management of farming operations.},

	abstract = {To explore the dynamic nature of geochemical conditions in bioirrigated marine permeable sediments, we studied the hydraulic activity of three tellinacean bivalve molluscs (the Pacific species Macoma nasuta and Macomona liliana, and the northern Atlantic and Pacific species Macoma balthica). We combined porewater pressure sensing, time-lapse photography and oxygen imaging to quantify the durations and frequencies of tellinid irrigation activity and the associated oxygen dynamics in the sediment. Porewater pressure records of all tellinids were dominated by intermittent porewater pressurization, induced by periodic water injection into the sediment through their excurrent siphons, which resulted in intermittent oxygen supply to subsurface sediments. The irrigation (two–12 minutes long) and intervals between subsequent irrigation bouts (1.5–13 minutes) varied among tellinid species and individual sizes. For large M. liliana and M. nasuta, the average intervals between irrigation bouts were sufficiently long (10 minutes and four minutes, respectively) to allow complete oxygen consumption in between irrigation bouts in all tested sediment types. Irrigation patterns of smaller conspecifics and the smaller species M. balthica were characterized by significantly shorter separation of irrigation bouts, which resulted in more continuous oxygenation of the sediment. Transport-reaction modeling confirmed these species- and size-specific geochemical signatures and indicated that the geochemical character of the sediment is largely conditioned by the interplay between temporal irrigation patterns and sedimentary oxygen consumption rates. For large tellinids, model simulations indicated that oscillatory rather than stationary geochemical conditions are prevalent in a wide range of sediment types, with oxic pockets collapsing completely between periods of active irrigation. Based on the model results we developed analytical approximations that allow estimation of spatio-temporal characteristics of sediment oxygenation for a wide range of sediment types and infaunal activity patterns. Our results emphasize the need to consider the intermittent nature of bioirrigation when studying the geochemical impact of infauna in permeable sediments.},

Long thought to be the preferred form of N for phytoplankton uptake, NH4+ may actually suppress overall growth when concentrations are sufficiently high. NH4+ has been well known to be inhibitory or repressive for NO3- uptake and assimilation, but the concentrations of NH4+ that promote vs. repress NO3- uptake, assimilation, and growth in different phytoplankton groups and under different growth conditions are not well understood. Here, we review N metabolism first in a "generic" eukaryotic cell, and the contrasting metabolic pathways and regulation of NH4+ and NO3- when these substrates are provided individually under equivalent growth conditions. Then the metabolic interactions of these substrates are described when both are provided together, emphasizing the cellular challenge of balancing nutrient acquisition with photosynthetic energy balance in dynamic environments. Conditions under which dissipatory pathways such as dissimilatory NO3-/NO2- reduction to NH4+ and photorespiration that may lead to growth suppression are highlighted. While more is known about diatoms, taxon-specific differences in NH4+ and NO3- metabolism that may contribute to changes in phytoplankton community composition when the composition of the N pool changes are presented. These relationships have important implications for harmful algal blooms, development of nutrient criteria for management, and modeling of nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, particularly in conditions where eutrophication is increasing and the redox state of N loads is changing.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia affects thousands of km2 of marine waters all over the world, and has caused mass mortality of marine animals, benthic defaunation and decline in fisheries production in many places. The severity, frequency occurrence and spatial scale of hypoxia have increased in the last few decades. Due to rapid human population growth and global warming, the problem of hypoxia is likely to become worse in the coming years. Molecular responses of marine animals to hypoxia are poorly known. In many animals, a haem protein probably serves as the cellular sensor for oxygen, and reactive oxygen species are generated as signaling molecules. In mammal and fish, a heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has been identified. HIF-1 receives signals from the molecular oxygen senor through redox reactions and/or phosphorylation, and in turn, regulates the transcription of a number of hypoxia-inducible genes, including genes involved in erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and glycolysis. These molecular responses then cascade into a series of biochemical and physiological adjustments, enabling the animal to survive better under hypoxic conditions. Marine animals respond to hypoxia by first attempting to maintain oxygen delivery (e.g. increases in respiration rate, number of red blood cells, or oxygen binding capacity of hemoglobin), then by conserving energy (e.g. metabolic depression, down regulation of protein synthesis and down regulation/modification of certain regulatory enzymes). Upon exposure to prolonged hypoxia, animals must eventually resort to anaerobic respiration. Hypoxia reduces growth and feeding, which may eventually affect individual fitness. Effects of hypoxia on reproduction and development of marine animals, albeit important in affecting species survival, remain almost unknown. Many fish and marine organisms can detect, and actively avoid hypoxia. Some benthos may leave their burrows and move to sediment surface during hypoxia. These behaviorial changes may render the animals more vulnerable to predation. Hypoxia may eliminate sensitive species, thereby causing major changes in species composition of benthic, fish and phytoplankton communities. Decreases in species diversity and species richness are well documented, and changes in trophodynamics and functional groups have also been reported. Under hypoxic conditions, there is a general tendency for suspended feeders to be replaced by deposit feeders; demersal fish by pelagic fish; and macrobenthos by meiobenthos. Microflagellates and nanoplankton also tend to dominate in the phytoplankton community in hypoxic environments. Existing evidence suggest that recovery of benthic communities in temperate region take two to several years. Recovery however, appears to be much quicker in subtropical environments. In natural conditions, hypoxia is often associated with increases in ammonia, hydrogen sulphide and particulate organic materials. The inability to isolate effects of hypoxia from interactions of these compounding factors makes it difficult to attribute many of the observed ecological effects to hypoxia. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {We present an ecosystem model that describes the biogeochemistry of a sediment nitrate reducing microbial community. In the model, the microbial community is represented as a distributed metabolic network. Biogeochemical pathways are controlled through the synthesis and allocation of biological structure that serves to catalyze each process. Allocation is determined by way of a thermodynamically constrained optimization according to the principle of maximum entropy production (MEP). According to the MEP principle, ecosystems will organize so as to maximize the dissipation of free energy based upon the available resources (nutrients and electron donors and acceptors). In the model, 3 nitrate reduction pathways, viz. heterotrophic denitrification, anammox, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, compete for electron acceptors (nitrate and nitrite). The model predicts switches in the dominant nitrate cycling pathways based upon the ratio of carbon to nitrate supply. An advantage of this approach over a traditional organism-centric kinetic approach is that the Monod growth parameters, maximum uptake rate (νmax), and half saturation (kM) constants are determined during the optimization procedure as opposed to parameters specified a priori. Such a model is therefore useful for applications where these kinetic parameters are unknown and difficult to measure, such as the marine subsurface, or when ecosystems undergo large-scale environmental perturbations resulting in shifts in the dominant organisms.},

	abstract = {The relative importance of two dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways, denitrification (DEN) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), was investigated in intact sediment cores from five different coastal marine field sites (Dorum, Aarhus Bight, Mississippi Delta, Limfjord and Janssand). The vertical distribution of DEN activity was examined using the acetylene inhibition technique combined with N2O microsensor measurements, whereas NH4+ production via DNRA was measured with a recently developed gel probe-stable isotope technique. At all field sites, dissimilatory nitrate reduction was clearly dominated by DEN (59–131\% of the total NO3− reduced) rather than by DNRA, irrespective of the sedimentary inventories of electron donors such as organic carbon, sulfide, and iron. Highest ammonium production via DNRA, accounting for up to 8.9\% of the total NO3− reduced, was found at a site with very high concentrations of total sulfide and NH4+ within and below the layer in which NO3− reduction occurred. Sediment from two field sites, one with low and one with high DNRA activity in the core incubations, was also used for slurry incubations. Now, in both sediments high DNRA activity was detected accounting for 37–77\% of the total NO3− reduced. These contradictory results might be explained by enhanced NO3− availability for DNRA bacteria in the sediment slurries compared to the core-incubated sediments in which diffusion of NO3− from the water column may only reach DEN bacteria, but not DNRA bacteria. The true partitioning of dissimilatory nitrate reduction between DNRA and DEN may thus lie in between the values found in whole core (underestimation of DNRA) and slurry incubations (overestimation of DNRA).},

	abstract = {Salmon farms in British Columbia now typically produce over 2000 mt of fish during each 18- to 24-month production cycle. An 18-month study of Stolt Sea Farms' Arrow Pass farm was undertaken in 1996 to examine the spatial and temporal extents of chemical and biological benthic effects. Microbial metabolism of farm biodeposits in nearfield sediments resulted in increased sulfide concentrations and decreased redox potential. These physicochemical changes modified the macrobenthic community. Species sensitive to enrichment were quickly extinguished from the immediate vicinity of the farm and were replaced by the organic carbon tolerant opportunistic annelids Capitella capitata and Ophryotrocha cf. vivipara. These effects extended to at least 50 m from the net-pen's perimeter on the downcurrent transect. Chemical remediation, defined as a return to reference levels of organic carbon, a reduction in free sediment sulfides to {\textbackslash}textless960 μM and an increase in sediment redox potential to reference conditions, began as soon as the harvest commenced and was complete by the end of harvest. Biological remediation began during the harvest and was complete within 6 months of fallow. Annelids and crustaceans recruited first into the remediating sediments and were followed by at least two seres of mollusks. Routine quarterly monitoring of sediment-free sulfides, redox potential and total volatile solids (TVS) at four Stolt Sea Farms' tenures from 1999 through present has demonstrated that sediment sulfides increase rapidly during the early stages of production and decrease equally quickly during harvest. Fallow periods of 4–6 months appeared adequate for complete chemical remediation at the tenures examined. Elevated concentrations of zinc, which is added as a supplement to salmon feeds, have been observed in sediments. However, they are bound by sulfides and are not biologically available. Zinc concentrations declined to background during chemical remediation. No cumulative effects associated with either organic carbon or zinc were observed at any of these farms during successive production cycles.},

	abstract = {Denitrification, the reduction of the nitrogen (N) oxides, nitrate (NO3?) and nitrite (NO2?), to the gases nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (N2), is important to primary production, water quality, and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere at ecosystem, landscape, regional, and global scales. Unfortunately, this process is very difficult to measure, and existing methods are problematic for different reasons in different places at different times. In this paper, we review the major approaches that have been taken to measure denitrification in terrestrial and aquatic environments and discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and future prospects for the different methods. Methodological approaches covered include (1) acetylene-based methods, (2) 15N tracers, (3) direct N2 quantification, (4) N2:Ar ratio quantification, (5) mass balance approaches, (6) stoichiometric approaches, (7) methods based on stable isotopes, (8) in situ gradients with atmospheric environmental tracers, and (9) molecular approaches. Our review makes it clear that the prospects for improved quantification of denitrification vary greatly in different environments and at different scales. While current methodology allows for the production of accurate estimates of denitrification at scales relevant to water and air quality and ecosystem fertility questions in some systems (e.g., aquatic sediments, well-defined aquifers), methodology for other systems, especially upland terrestrial areas, still needs development. Comparison of mass balance and stoichiometric approaches that constrain estimates of denitrification at large scales with point measurements (made using multiple methods), in multiple systems, is likely to propel more improvement in denitrification methods over the next few years.},

Monthly measurements of fluxes at the water sediment interface at two stations have been compared. One station (UC) is located under a culture table, and is subject to intensive accumulation of organic matter (biodeposition); the other (OC) is located outside the area directly under the impact of the culture activities. Oxygen consumption ranged from 288.24 to 1026.85 ??mol ?? m-2 ?? h-1 according to the season and the station. Ammonium production was maximal at station UC in Summer (600 ??mol ?? m-2 ?? h-1) and minimal at station OC in the Autumn (30 ??mol ?? m-2 ?? h-1). In general, the fluxes recorded at station UC were 1.8-3 times higher than those recorded at station OC for oxygen and 1-5 times higher for ammonium. Nevertheless, the variability between stations was lower than the seasonal variability. Using a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), it was possible to point out the occurrence of an atypical event that was responsible for the disruption of the seasonal cycle. This event was a state of hypoxia known locally under the generic name of malaigue. The dystrophic crisis consists of a major perturbation of the ecosystem, responsible for a massive mortality affecting both the benthos and the reared stocks.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry of aquaculture ponds is dominated by biological transformations of N added to ponds in the form of inorganic or organic fertilizers and formulated feeds. Nitrogen application in excess of pond assimilatory capacity can lead to the deterioration of water quality through the accumulation of nitrogenous compounds (e.g., ammonia and nitrite) with toxicity to fish or shrimp. Principal sources of ammonia include fish excretion and sediment flux derived from the mineralization of organic matter and molecular diffusion from reduced sediment, although cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation and atmospheric deposition are occasionally important. Principal sinks for ammonia include phytoplankton uptake and nitrification. The magnitude of losses by ammonia volatilization and ammonium fixation to cation exchange sites is minor, but unknown. Interactions between pond sediment and water are important regulators of N biogeochemistry. Sediment represents a source of ammonia and a sink for nitrite and nitrate. The large volume of reduced sediment suggests that the potential for N removal by denitrification is high, although the magnitude of N removal by this mechanism is low because nitrification and denitrification are tightly coupled in aquatic sediments and sediment nitrification is limited by the depth of sediment oxygen penetration. Nitrogen biogeochemistry of aquaculture ponds is affected by feeds and feeding practices, water exchange and circulation, aeration, pond depth and other management procedures. Opportunities for management of N biogeochemistry are limited and goals are based largely on the intensity of fish production.},

	abstract = {Salmon aquaculture discharges organic wastes into the marine environment. Salmon metabolism and the waste discharges add nutrients and organic matter to and remove oxygen from both the water column and sediments. The salmon industry in Southwestern New Brunswick (SWNB) is used to illustrate how waste discharges can be estimated in the absence of detailed information on farm operations. A fish growth model and mass balance calculations are used to estimate carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus wastes at the farm scale. Feed nutrition data and environmental measurements are used to partition wastes into fractions, and to estimate the oxygen demand. The predicted demand at the time of maximum discharge is 200 times greater than the oxygen uptake measured in surface sediments at cages, suggesting that most farm wastes are dispersed over wide areas and do not accumulate directly under cages. The number of farmed fish in an inlet is then used to predict total discharges to that inlet. In SWNB, salmon aquaculture is the largest anthropogenic source of organic input to the coastal zone. The significance of the wastes on inlet scales (2–25 km) is evaluated by comparing element fluxes through salmon farms with fluxes due to natural processes: primary production, nutrient regeneration, and community respiration. In intensively farmed bays, fluxes due to salmon farms reach values of 20, 330 and 160\% of those due to natural processes for oxygen, nitrogen and carbon, respectively: significant changes to the ecosystem have occurred in these bays. Spatial scales are critical in describing such impacts: effects will be greater close to the farms, and smaller when averaged over larger areas.},

	abstract = {Coastal hypoxia (defined here as {\textbackslash}textless 1.42 ml L-1; 62.5 mu M; 2 mg L-1, approx. 30\% oxygen saturation) develops seasonally in many estuaries, fjords, and along open coasts as a result of natural upwelling or from anthropogenic eutrophication induced by riverine nutrient inputs. Permanent hypoxia occurs naturally in some isolated seas and marine basins as well as in open slope oxygen minimum zones. Responses of benthos to hypoxia depend on the duration, predictability, and intensity of oxygen depletion and on whether H2S is formed. Under suboxic conditions, large mats of filamentous sulfide oxidizing bacteria cover the seabed and consume sulfide. They are hypothesized to provide a detoxified microhabitat for eukaryotic benthic communities. Calcareous foraminiferans and nematodes are particularly tolerant of low oxygen concentrations and may attain high densities and dominance, often in association with microbial mats. When oxygen is sufficient to support metazoans, small, soft-bodied invertebrates (typically annelids), often with short generation times and elaborate branchial structures, predominate. Large taxa are more sensitive than small taxa to hypoxia. Crustaceans and echinoderms are typically more sensitive to hypoxia, with lower oxygen thresholds, than annelids, sipunculans, molluscs and cnidarians. Mobile fish and shellfish will migrate away from low-oxygen areas. Within a species, early life stages may be more subject to oxygen stress than older life stages. Hypoxia alters both the structure and function of benthic communities, but effects may differ with regional hypoxia history. Human-caused hypoxia is generally linked to eutrophication, and occurs adjacent to watersheds with large populations or agricultural activities. Many occurrences are seasonal, within estuaries, fjords or enclosed seas of the North Atlantic and the NW Pacific Oceans. Benthic faunal responses, elicited at oxygen levels below 2 ml L-1, typically involve avoidance or mortality of large species and elevated abundances of enrichment opportunists, sometimes prior to population crashes. Areas of low oxygen persist seasonally or continuously beneath upwelling regions, associated with the upper parts of oxygen minimum zones (SE Pacific, W Africa, N Indian Ocean). These have a distribution largely distinct from eutrophic areas and support a resident fauna that is adapted to survive and reproduce at oxygen concentrations {\textbackslash}textless 0.5 ml L-1. Under both natural and eutrophication-caused hypoxia there is loss of diversity, through attrition of intolerant species and elevated dominance, as well as reductions in body size. These shifts in species composition and diversity yield altered trophic structure, energy flow pathways, and corresponding ecosystem services such as production, organic matter cycling and organic C burial. Increasingly the influences of nature and humans interact to generate or exacerbate hypoxia. A warmer ocean is more stratified, holds less oxygen, and may experience greater advection of oxygen-poor source waters, making new regions subject to hypoxia. Future understanding of benthic responses to hypoxia must be established in the context of global climate change and other human influences such as overfishing, pollution, disease, habitat loss, and species invasions.},

Here we investigated the effects of such advective bio-irrigation on carbon and nitrogen cycling in sandy sediments. To this end, we combined a range of complementary experimental and modelling approaches in a microcosm study of the lugworm Arenicola marina (Polychaeta: Annelida). Bio-irrigation rates were determined using uranine as a tracer, while benthic fluxes of oxygen (O2), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NH4+, ΣNO2− + NO3−) and dinitrogen (N2) were measured in closed-core incubations containing lugworms acclimatized for a relatively short (2 d) and long (3 wk) duration. The fluxes induced by A. marina were compared to those induced by mechanical mimics that simulate the flow pattern induced by the lugworm. These mechanical mimics proved a useful tool to simulate the effect of lugworm irrigation on sediment biogeochemistry. Subsequently, reactive transport model simulations were performed to check the consistency of the measured fluxes and rates, and to construct closed mass balances for sedimentary nitrogen. This reactive transport model successfully captured the essential features of the nitrogen cycling within the sediment. Advective irrigation by both lugworm and mechanical mimics significantly stimulated the sediments O2 consumption, organic matter mineralization rate (TCO2 release), and denitrification rate (N2 production). While sedimentary O2 consumption was directly correlated to advective input of O2, increasing irrigation rates increased the importance of coupled nitrification-denitrification over the external input of nitrate from the overlying water.},

The major diagenetic processes of the reaction network were first identified on the basis of literature information and his- toric data. Next, the organic carbon (OC) flux at a pristine site near the farm was estimated by fitting the vertical profiles of pore water and solid-state chemical species measured in the field. DEPOMOD was then used to predict the fluxes of OC due to the release of uneaten feed and faeces at various dis- tances away from the farm. These fluxes were added to the background ‘natural' fluxes and used as forcing functions for the RTM. Comparison of the simulated transient profiles with data collected at an impacted site revealed that the RTM model satisfactorily predicted the transient dynamics of the system. We discuss the use of the model for cost-effective environmental impact assessments, site selection and the optimization of husbandry practices.},

Microbial nitrogen (N) transformations at the sediment-water interface are important in determining system productivity and the development and maintenance of hypoxia. Intact sediment cores were incubated in a continuous-flow system with stable isotope tracers to identify and quantify important N sources (e.g., N fixation), sinks (e.g., denitrification and anammox), and links (e.g., dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, DNRA). Microbial N sinks on the Louisiana-Texas continental shelf remove up to 68 \% of the total N load from the Mississippi River watershed, and up to 29 \% of this N removal (mean = 11.8 +/- 1.7 \%) may be due to anammox. The highest N-2 production rates and ammonium effluxes were observed at low bottom-water oxygen concentrations, and sediments were a significant source of ammonium to the water column at all times. DNRA and heterotrophic N fixation were not consistent pathways for total sediment N fluxes, but their potential importance to N balance and productivity in the system warrants further study and inclusion in ecosystem models. Physical disturbance from passage of two hurricanes in 2008 resulted in lower N cycling rates and sediment oxygen consumption, with sediment processes migrating into the water column. Denitrification is the dominant N sink in the northern Gulf of Mexico and provides a valuable ecosystem service by mitigating N loads from the Mississippi River watershed, particularly during seasonal bottom-water hypoxia events.},

	abstract = {Disentangling the roles of environmental change and natural environmental variability on biologically mediated ecosystem processes is paramount to predict future marine ecosystem functioning. Bioturbation, the biogenic mixing of sediments, has a regulating role in marine biogeochemical processes. However, our understanding of bioturbation as a community level process and of its environmental drivers is still limited by loose use of terminology, and a lack of consensus about what bioturbation is. To help resolve these challenges, this empirical study investigated the links between four different attributes of bioturbation (bioturbation depth, activity and distance, and biodiffusive transport); the ability of an index of bioturbation (BPc) to predict each of them; and their relation to seasonality, in a shallow coastal system – the Western Channel Observatory, UK. Bioturbation distance depended on changes in benthic community structure, while the other three attributes were more directly influenced by seasonality in food availability. In parallel, BPc successfully predicted bioturbation distance but not the other attributes of bioturbation. This study therefore highlights that community bioturbation results from this combination of processes responding to environmental variability at different time-scales. However, community level measurements of bioturbation across environmental variability are still scarce, and BPc is calculated using commonly available data on benthic community structure and the functional classification of invertebrates. Therefore, BPc could be used to support the growth of landscape scale bioturbation research, but future uses of the index need to consider which bioturbation attributes the index actually predicts. As BPc predicts bioturbation distance, estimated here using a random-walk model applicable to community settings, studies using either of the metrics should be directly comparable and contribute to a more integrated future for bioturbation research.},

However, the factors that regulate anammox-driven nitrogen loss have remained unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive nitrogen budget for the eastern tropical South Pacific oxygen minimum zone, using measurements of nutrient concentrations, experimentally determined rates of nitrogen transformation and a numerical model of export production. Anammox was the dominant mode of nitrogen loss at the time of sampling. Rates of anammox, and related nitrogen transformations, were greatest in the productive shelf waters, and tailed off with distance from the coast. Within the shelf region, anammox activity peaked in both upper and bottom waters. Overall, rates of nitrogen transformation, including anammox, were strongly correlated with the export of organic matter. We suggest that the sinking of organic matter, and thus the release of ammonium into the water column, together with benthic ammonium release, fuel nitrogen loss from oxygen minimum zones.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies describing the short-term recovery of benthic habitats impacted by organic wastes from commercial salmon farms have been published. A few of these studies have continued for up to 2 years. The Carrie Bay salmon farm in the Broughton Archipelago of British Columbia began operation in 1990 and produced four crops of Atlantic salmon. It was fallowed in 1998 after producing 2587 mt of Atlantic salmon in the preceding production cycle. Significant accumulations of organic waste were observed near the netpens in 1997 when the farm was close to maximum salmon biomass. Bottom sediments were blackened with iron sulfides and gas ebullition together with extensive Beggiatoa mats were observed to a distance of 145 m on the southern transect in 1997. Patchy Beggia remained near the netpens in 1999. Twelve benthic surveys have been completed in Carrie Bay over the last 7 years. The database reported herein describes slow, but steady, remediation of this site. Chemical remediation, including reductions in total volatile solids (TVS), free sulfides, redox potential and zinc were nearly complete at distances {\textbackslash}textgreater80 m in 2002 and rapid and significant additional chemical remediation was observed throughout the area in 2003. Sediment concentrations of zinc have declined throughout this study at all distances and were approaching background concentrations in 2002 and 2003. Macrofaunal communities at Carrie Bay's reference stations were dominated by mollusks with significantly fewer annelids and very few crustaceans. This community did not respond to organic enrichment in the classic way described by Pearson and Rosenberg [Oceanogr. Mar. Boil. Annu. Rev. 16 (1978) 229], which has accurately predicted the macrobenthic response at many intensive aquaculture facilities. None of the eight opportunistic taxa frequently found proliferating in enriched sediments near B.C. salmon farms were a large component of the Carrie Bay macrobenthos at any place or at any time. Rather, a single annelid (Nephtys cornuta) was found in moderate abundance and several bivalve mollusks that dominated local reference communities have slowly recruited into the remediating sediments. Biological remediation was nearing completion at distances ???80 m from the netpens, but was not complete under and at shorter distances in 2002 following 4 years of fallow. Based on regression analysis, it is predicted that chemical remediation (sulfides ???447 ??M) sufficient to support half of the common taxa observed at the local reference station will be complete in 2004 following approximately 65 months in fallow. Unlike four other farms in the Broughton Archipelago, where sulfide concentrations exceeded 20,000 ??M, and where chemical remediation has been complete in less than 6 months, sulfide concentrations at Carrie Bay have remained {\textbackslash}textless9410 ??M throughout this study. These relatively lower sulfide concentrations; the unique pattern of biological remediation; and the relatively long chemical and biological remediation times observed at Carrie Bay point out the need for a better understanding of the diagenesis of labile carbon compounds in sediments underlying intensive aquaculture operations. A better understanding of the underlying causes of the biochemical processes observed in this study will significantly aid farm operators and regulators in selecting benthic habitats with optimal sustainability for modern salmon farming. In addition to describing the transport of waste, computer programs designed to predict the environmental response to intensive aquaculture must incorporate modules assessing the biogeochemical and biological response to these inputs before their output can predict the unusual responses observed in Carrie Bay. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, the quantitative significance of anammox in estuarine sediments is variable, and measurements have been limited to a few estuaries. We measured anammox and conventional denitrification activities in sediments along salinity gradients in the Chesapeake Bay and two of its sub-estuaries, the Choptank River and Patuxent River. Homogenized sediments were incubated with (14/15)N amendments of NH4+, NO3-, and NO2- to determine relative activities of anammox and denitrification. The percent of N2 production due to anammox (ra\%) ranged from 0 to 22\% in the Chesapeake system, with the highest ra\% in the freshwater portion of the main stem of upper Chesapeake Bay, where water column NO3- concentrations are consistently high. Intermediate levels of relative anammox (10\%) were detected at locations corresponding to tidal freshwater and mesohaline locations in the Choptank River, whereas anammox was not detected in the tidal freshwater location in the Patuxent River. Anammox activity was also not detected in the seaward end of Chesapeake Bay, where water column No3- concentrations are consistently low. The ra\% did not correlate with NH4+ accumulation rate in anoxic sediment incubations, but ra\% was related to water column NO3- concentrations and salinity. Anammox bacterial communities were also examined by amplifying DNA extracted from the upper Chesapeake Bay sediment with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers that are specific for 16S rRNA genes of anammox organisms. A total of 35 anammox-like sequences were detected, and phylogenetic analysis grouped the sequences in two distinct clusters belonging to the Candidatus "Scalindua" genus.},

In particular, increasing discharges of solid and dissolved fish excretions, nutrients and therapeutic chemicals have coincided with greater public awareness of the possibility of environmental damage. This has stimulated a number of criticisms, drawn from a wide spectrum of interests, ranging from the use of natural fish stocks to produce fish meal for aqua feeds to the effects of enhanced nutrient input on the coastal marine environment. The present study reviews available information on the environmental effects of feeding practices in salmonid aquaculture in Europe. Accumulation of waste food and fish faecal material results in changes in the sediment under fish cages, characterized by a low redox potential, high content of organic material and accumulation of nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds. Although significant environmental impacts have been reported in the literature at distances of up to 100 m from the cages, in general such impacts are reported to be localized to within 20 - 50 m around the cages. For farmed salmon and trout, mass balance models have been developed for nitrogen and phosphorus, indicating that 50\% of the nitrogen and 28\% of the phosphorus supplied with the food is wasted in dissolved form. The maximum nutrient release can be estimated from the hydrographic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the farm, such as water volume, tidal water exchange and currents. At present production levels, improvements in the feeding efficiency and feed quality of aquafeeds could reduce waste and consequent environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {To enable better predictive capability of the impact from large marine cage fish farms on the benthos and improved objectivity in the regulatory decision-making process, a computer particle tracking model DEPOMOD was developed. DEPOMOD predicts the solids accumulation on the seabed arising from a fish farm and associated changes in the benthic faunal community. The grid generation module allows the user to set up a grid containing information on depth, cage and sampling station positions for the area of interest. Given the information on wastage rates of fish food and faeces and hydrodynamics of the area, the initial deposition of particles on the seabed can then be predicted with the particle tracking model. The resuspension model then redistributes particles according to near-bed current flow fields to predict the net solids accumulated on the seabed within the grid area. From quantitative relationships between benthic community descriptors and solids accumulation, predictions of the level of benthic community impact can then be made. The particle tracking model was validated using sediment trap studies. Model predictions of flux (g/m2/day) generally agreed well with field data with an accuracy of ?? 20\% and ?? 13\% for a dispersive and depositional site, respectively. Using parameters from the validated resuspension model (rare among models in this field), semi-empirical quantitative relationships between predicted solids accumulation (g/m2/year) and observed Infaunal Trophic Index (ITI) and total individual abundance were established using data from numerous Scottish marine fish farms. A submodel was also validated for predicting feed input throughout a growing cycle for planning purposes. DEPOMOD may be used for assessing the potential impact of a farm throughout a growing cycle, or if the biomass consent is increased. It may also be used in the site selection process of a new farm to investigate the proposed farm position and biomass levels. Prediction of the dispersion of particulates during use of in-feed medicines may also be undertaken. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Invasive species and bottom-water hypoxia both constitute major global threats to the diversity and integrity of marine ecosystems. These stressors may interact with unexpected consequences, as invasive species that require an initial environmental disturbance to become established can subsequently become important drivers of ecological change. There is recent evidence that improved bottom-water oxygen conditions in coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea coincide with increased abundances of the invasive polychaetes Marenzelleria spp. Using a reactive-transport model, we demonstrate that the long-term bioirrigation activities of dense Marenzelleria populations have a major impact on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics. This may facilitate the switch from a seasonally hypoxic system back to a normoxic system by reducing the potential for sediment-induced eutrophication in the upper water column. In contrast to short-term laboratory experiments, our simulations, which cover a 10-year period, show that Marenzelleria has the potential to enhance long-term phosphorus retention in muddy sediments. Over time bioirrigation leads to a substantial increase in the iron-bound phosphorus content of sediments while reducing the concentration of labile organic carbon. As surface sediments are maintained oxic, iron oxyhydroxides are able to persist and age into more refractory forms. The model illustrates mechanisms through which Marenzelleria can act as a driver of ecological change, although hypoxic disturbance or natural population declines in native species may be needed for them to initially become established. Invasive species are generally considered to have a negative impact; however, we show here that one of the main recent invaders in the Baltic Sea may provide important ecosystem services. This may be of particular importance in low-diversity systems, where disturbances may dramatically alter ecosystem services due to low functional redundancy. Thus, an environmental problem in one region may be either exacerbated or alleviated by a single species from another region, with potentially ecosystem-wide consequences.},

Coastal regions often receive large anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen that cause eutrophication. The impact of these nitrogen additions has a profound effect in estuaries and coastal lagoons where water exchange is limited. Such increased nutrient loading promotes the growth of phytoplankton and fast growing pelagic macroalgae while rooted plants (sea-grasses) and benthic are suppressed due to reduced light availability. This shift from benthic to pelagic primary production introduces large diurnal variations in oxygen concentrations in the water column. In addition oxygen consumption in the surface sediments increases due to the deposition of readily degradable biomass. In this review the physico-chemical and biological factors regulating nitrogen cycling in coastal marine ecosystems are considered in relation to developing effective management programmes to rehabilitate seagrass communities in lagoons currently dominated by pelagic macroalgae and/or cyanobacteria.},

	abstract = {In the global nitrogen cycle, bacterial denitrification is recognized as the only quantitatively important process that converts fixed nitrogen to atmospheric nitrogen gas, N2 , thereby influencing many aspects of ecosystem function and global biogeochemistry. However, we have found that a process novel to the marine nitrogen cycle, anaerobic oxidation of ammonium coupled to nitrate reduction, contributes substantially to N2 production in marine sediments. Incubations with 15 N-labeled nitrate or ammonium demonstrated that during this process, N2 is formed through one-to-one pairing of nitrogen from nitrate and ammonium, which clearly separates the process from denitrification. Nitrite, which accumulated transiently, was likely the oxidant for ammonium, and the process is thus similar to the anammox process known from wastewater bioreactors. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation accounted for 24 and 67\% of the total N2 production at two typical continental shelf sites, whereas it was detectable but insignificant relative to denitrification in a eutrophic coastal bay. However, rates of anaerobic ammonium oxidation were higher in the coastal sediment than at the deepest site and the variability in the relative contribution to N2 production between sites was related to large differences in rates of denitrification. Thus, the relative importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation and denitrification in N2 production appears to be regulated by the availability of their reduced substrates. By shunting nitrogen directly from ammonium to N2 , anaerobic ammonium oxidation promotes the removal of fixed nitrogen in the oceans. The process can explain ammonium deficiencies in anoxic waters and sediments, and it may contribute significantly to oceanic nitrogen budgets. The},

	abstract = {The rate and factors controlling denitrification in marine sediments have been investigated using a prognostic diagenetic model. The model is forced with observed carbon fluxes, bioturbation and sedimentation rates, and bottom water conditions. It can reproduce rates of aerobic mineralization, denitrification, and fluxes of oxygen, nitrate, and ammonium. The globally integrated rate of denitrification is estimated by this model to be about 230-285 Tg N yr", with about 100 Tg N yr' occurring in shelf sediments. This estimate is significantly higher than literature estimates (12-89 Tg N yr"), mainly because of a proposed upward revision of denitrification rates in slope and deep-sea sediments. Higher sedimentary denitrification estimates require a revision of the marine nitrogen budget and lowering of the oceanic residence time of nitrogen down to about 2 xl 03 years and are consistent with reported low NIP remineralization ratios between 1000 and 3000 m. Rates of benthic denitrification are most sensitive to the flux of labile organic carbon arriving at the sediment-water interface and bottom water concentrations of nitrate and oxygen. Denitrification always increases when bottom water nitrate increases but may increase or decrease if oxygen in the bottom water increases. Nitrification is by far the most important source of nitrate for denitrification, except for organic- rich sediments underlying oxygen-poor and nitrate-rich water.},

Results are given in this paper for diagenetic modeling of two sites from the area on the Louisiana shelf west of the Mississippi River Delta known as the "dead zone". This is one of the largest and most studied regions where seasonal coastal hypoxia occurs. The diagenetic model was capable of generating good matches with depth profiles at both sites in the upper 8??cm. Moderate differences between predicted and observed concentrations below this depth are most likely due to the highly non-steady state conditions in this region. The model was also able to predict extremely low dissolved sulfide concentrations and bacterial sulfate reduction rates that were in good agreement with independent direct observations. A sensitivity analysis of the model to input parameters showed that the model was much more sensitive to changes in values under hypoxic conditions than norm-oxic or anoxic conditions in the overlying water. Simulations were carried out to first determine how the profiles of sediment porewater parameters and interfacial fluxes would change under differing quasi-steady state conditions where overlying dissolved oxygen concentrations and the rate of bioirrigation were varied. Next a non-steady state simulation was run to investigate how sediment biogeochemistry would change between these conditions during a hypothetical annual cycle. Results demonstrated a clear need to better understand the dynamic relationship among overlying water oxygen concentrations, the behavior of the benthic faunal community responsible for bioirrigation and sediment biogeochemistry. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In January, the sediment ammonium concentra-tions ranged from 418 mnolcm -3 (surface) to 149nmol cm -3 (12 cm depth) at the mussel farm and from 86 to 112 nmol cm -3 at the reference site.

	abstract = {Nitrogen fixation is an essential process that biologically transforms atmospheric dinitrogen gas to ammonia, therefore compensating for nitrogen losses occurring via denitrification and anammox. Currently, inputs and losses of nitrogen to the ocean resulting from these processes are thought to be spatially separated: nitrogen fixation takes place primarily in open ocean environments (mainly through diazotrophic cyanobacteria), whereas nitrogen losses occur in oxygen-depleted intermediate waters and sediments (mostly via denitrifying and anammox bacteria). Here we report on rates of nitrogen fixation obtained during two oceanographic cruises in 2005 and 2007 in the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP), a region characterized by the presence of coastal upwelling and a major permanent oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Our results show significant rates of nitrogen fixation in the water column; however, integrated rates from the surface down to 120 m varied by approximately 30 fold between cruises (7.5+/-4.6 versus 190+/-82.3 micromol m(-2) d(-1)). Moreover, rates were measured down to 400 m depth in 2007, indicating that the contribution to the integrated rates of the subsurface oxygen-deficient layer was approximately 5 times higher (574+/-294 micromol m(-2) d(-1)) than the oxic euphotic layer (48+/-68 micromol m(-2) d(-1)). Concurrent molecular measurements detected the dinitrogenase reductase gene nifH in surface and subsurface waters. Phylogenetic analysis of the nifH sequences showed the presence of a diverse diazotrophic community at the time of the highest measured nitrogen fixation rates. Our results thus demonstrate the occurrence of nitrogen fixation in nutrient-rich coastal upwelling systems and, importantly, within the underlying OMZ. They also suggest that nitrogen fixation is a widespread process that can sporadically provide a supplementary source of fixed nitrogen in these regions.},

	abstract = {Biologically available nitrogen is removed from ecosystems through the microbial processes of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) or denitrification, while dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) retains it. A mechanistic understanding of controls on partitioning among these pathways is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to conduct a manipulative experiment to determine the influence of organic C and NO3− loading on partitioning. Sediment was collected from a location on the southern New England shelf (78 m water depth) and sieved. Half of the sediment was mixed with freeze-dried phytoplankton and the other half was not. Sediment was then spread into 1.5 mm, “thin discs” closed at the bottom and placed in large aquarium tanks with filtered, N2/CO2 sparged seawater to maintain O2 limited conditions. Half of the discs received high NO3− loading, while the other half received low NO3− loading, resulting in a multifactorial design with four treatments: no C addition, low NO3− (−C−N); C addition, low NO3− (+C−N); no C addition, high NO3− (−C+N); and C addition, high NO3− (+C+N). Sediment discs were incubated in the tanks for 7 weeks, during which time inorganic N (NH4+, NO3−, and NO2−) was monitored, and sediment discs were periodically removed from the tanks to conduct 15N isotope labeling experiments in vials to measure potential rates of anammox, denitrification, and DNRA. Temporal dynamics of inorganic N concentrations in the tanks were indicative of anoxic N metabolism, with strong response of the build up or consumption of the intermediate NO2−, depending on treatments. Vial incubation experiments with added 15NO2− + 14NH4+ indicated significant denitrification and DNRA activity in sediment thin discs, but incubations with added 15NH4+ + 14NO2− indicated anammox was not at all significant. Inorganic N concentrations in the tanks were fit to a reactive transport model assuming different N transformations. Organic C decomposition rates were inferred based on modeled rates as well as stoichiometric conversions of NH4+ production in pre-incubated vials. Based on model results, partitioning between DNRA and N2 production was positively linearly related to the ratio of C decomposition to NO3− reduction rates (C/NO3−) but not C decomposition alone. Based on vial results, partitioning was significantly related to C decomposition. Overall, this study supports the hypothesis that high organic C loading is a prerequisite for DNRA to be favored over denitrification but that N2 production may still be significant when organic C is high depending on NO3− availability.},

Little Lagoon, Alabama, USA, is affected by anthropogenic perturbations and has N inputs from nitrate (NO3 −)-contaminated submarine groundwater discharge. N cycle pathways (N-fixation, denitrification, anammox, and DNRA) and benthic fluxes were measured at three sites over a year to investigate the hypothesis that DNRA, by producing ammonium (NH4 +) as a dissimilatory end product of NO3 − reduction, was a significant process retaining bioavailable fixed N in Little Lagoon. DNRA was found to be an important NO3 − reduction pathway, especially in the summer months (study average: 52.1 μmol N m−2 h−1) compared to denitrification (study average 7.7 μmol N m−2 h−1). Sulfidic sediments during the majority of the year interfere with denitrification and result in decreased N loss through denitrification. The conversion of NO3 − to the more biologically preferred form of N, NH4 + via DNRA, means that NO3 − reduction has considerable nourishing potential and likely will affect both ecosystem function and services. These results indicate that NO3 − reduction may contribute to, rather than counteract, eutrophication during warm summers in estuaries receiving high N inputs. As estuarine sediments provide a key ecosystem function of N removal, excess anthropogenic N input jeopardizes their ability to effectively remove reactive N in Little Lagoon and likely in other impacted ecosystems.},

This process has resulted in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in aquaculture environments, in the increase of antibiotic resistance in fish pathogens, in the transfer of these resistance determinants to bacteria of land animals and to human pathogens, and in alterations of the bacterial flora both in sediments and in the water column. The use of large amounts of antibiotics that have to be mixed with fish food also creates problems for industrial health and increases the opportunities for the presence of residual antibiotics in fish meat and fish products. Thus, it appears that global efforts are needed to promote more judicious use of prophylactic antibiotics in aquaculture as accumulating evidence indicates that unrestricted use is detrimental to fish, terrestrial animals, and human health and the environment.},

The fish farm contained about 120 000 Dicentrarchus labrax (density 18 kg m-3). The most evident changes in the benthic habitat under the cage were a large accumulation of primary organic material (phytopigment concentrations up to 44 \{micro\}g g-1), changes in sedimentary organic matter composition (increased lipid levels related to the composition of the fish diet), and a strong reduction of redox potential values, which resulted in a significant reduction of meiofaunal penetration depth into the sediments. Organic loads had a clear impact on meiofaunal densities, which were 50\% lower under the cage than at the control site (1112\{+/-\}118 and 2160\{+/-\}339 ind. 10 cm-2, respectively). Compared with the control, farm sediments also showed an increased importance of copepods, which dominated the meiofauna together with nematodes (both 39\% of the total density) and polychaetes (17\%). The removal of the fish farm from the site on July 1997 allowed an analysis to be made of the initial short and medium-term recovery of the assemblages. After two months, meiofaunal densities were closer to the control (about 30\% recovery). Community structure recovered only partially to the characteristics typical of the study area, with increased importance of nematodes (about 70\% of total density) and reduced copepod contribution, but it was still characterized by a lower number of taxa after four months. These data suggest that meiofaunal recovery after fish farm disturbance is rapid, but far from complete after four months.},

	abstract = {Benthic communities and benthic mineralization were studied in two shallow coastal regions of New Zealand: Tasman Bay, a possible future site for mussel farm development, and Beatrix Bay, which already hosts several longline mussel farms. In Tasman Bay, microphytobenthic (MPB) production added significantly to the total primary production of the bay. The activity of benthic microalgae had a pronounced effect on oxic conditions, solute exchange and denitrification rates. Benthic mineralization, quantified as the dark oxygen uptake, was in the range of 675±11 μmol m−2 h−1. Denitrification rates were high and fueled entirely by nitrate produced by the nitrifying community within the sediment. Competition for inorganic nitrogen between benthic microalgae and nitrifiers/denitrifiers resulted in diel variation in nitrogen cycling and reduced the inorganic nitrogen efflux and denitrification activity in the light. Calculated in electron equivalents, denitrification accounted for 11–20\% of the total carbon mineralization—one of the highest numbers reported for coastal sediments. Reduced sediments, containing low MPB biomass and few subsurface macroinvertebrate species, were observed below a mussel farm in Beatrix Bay, presumably due to the intensified sedimentation of organic matter. Oxygen consumption increased in the organic-rich sediments, and ammonium effluxes were up to 14 times higher than those of unaffected sediments 250 m away from the farm. Denitrification rates below the farm were low as the coupled nitrification–denitrification was inhibited by the presence of sulfide. The dissimilative reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DRNA) was, however, stimulated in the reduced sediment. The enhanced benthic mineralization was associated with sulfidic sediments and a lower nitrogen removal rate due to impeded benthic photosynthesis and denitrification activity. The described local conditions associated with mussel farming should be taken into account when new areas are considered for development.},

High nitrate loading degrades water quality and is linked to eutrophica tion and harmful algal blooms, especially in coastal marine waters. Past research on nitrate removal processes has emphasized plant or microbial uptake (assimilation) or respiratory denitrification by bacteria. The increasing application of stable isotopes and other tracer techniques to the study of nitrate removal has yielded a growing body of evidence for alternative, microbially mediated processes of nitrate transformation. These include dissim ilatory (the reduction of nitrogen into other inorganic compounds, coupled to energy producing processes) reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA), chemoautotrophic denitrification via sulfur or iron oxidation, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), as well as abiotic nitrate removal processes. Here, we review evi dence for the importance of alternative nitrate removal pathways in aquatic ecosystems and discuss how the pos sible prevalence of these pathways may alter views of N cycling and its controls. These alternative pathways are of particular importance for the management of excess N in the environment, especially in cases where nitrate is transformed to ammonium, a biologically available and less mobile N form, rather than to dinitrogen gas.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The metabolic activity of the microphytobenthos may effect inorganic nutrient exchange across the sediment-water interface. Ammonium exchange across the sediment-water interface was investigated in intact sediment cores and microphytobenthos isolated using lens tissue. Ammonium uptake rates of lens tissue extracts in darkness were 11.4 ± 5 µmol (mg chl a)-1 h-1 (mean ± SE). Uptake by lens tissue extracts was 2 to 5 times greater in the light than dark; however, uptake under illumination was not correlated with photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) intensity. Emersion under illumination and in the dark affected ammonium exchange after immersion in sediment cores. In dark-emersed cores there was net ammonium efflux from the sediment into the overlying water after immersion. An illuminated emersion period reduced the flux of ammonium to the overlying water or affected uptake after immersion. There was a significant positive relationship between the length of the period of emersion under illumination (and therefore photosynthesis) and the subsequent ammonium demand of the sediment after immersion. Porewater profiles revealed low ammonium concentrations in illuminated-emersed cores compared to dark-emersed and dark-immersed cores. Ammonium demand in illuminated-emersed cores was a result of direct and indirect effects by the microphytobenthos. As well as direct ammonium uptake in the light, the production of oxygen probably stimulated oxic bacterial processes such as nitrification (NH4+ to NO3-) in the surface of the sediment. These data show that the effect of the illumination and emersion period should be considered when nutrient budgets are calculated for intertidal, cohesive sediments dominated by microphytobenthos.},

Sediment organic matter concentration and macrofauna community composition were manipulated in microcosms and changes in total benthic metabolism (oxygen consumption, TCO2 production), anaerobic metabolism (sulfate reduction rates), nutrient fluxes and sediment parameters were followed for a period of 3 weeks. Mineralization rates were found to be highly correlated with irrigation velocities and largest fauna effects were found in the Danish sediments with the large and active irrigating climax species (Nereis diversicolor and Macoma balthica). Eastern Mediterranean climax species (Glycera rouxii and Naineris laevigata) also stimulated mineralization rates but to a smaller extent due to lower irrigation, whereas the opportunistic species (Capitella in Danish sediment and Hermodice carunculata in Cypriote sediment) showed less effect on mineralization. Ammonium and phosphate release increased with increasing irrigation velocities, but much less in Cyprus indicating higher nutrient retention at the ultra-oligotrophic location compared to eutrophic Danish site. Irrigation velocities, and thus mineralization rates, increased by organic matter loading, indicating larger fauna-induced oxidation in enriched environments. The result implies that a change in fauna structure in fish farm sediment towards smaller opportunistic polychaete species with lower irrigation will result in slower mineralization rates and potentially increase accumulation of organic waste products.},

The association of fish farms with disease emergence in sympatric wild fish stocks remains one of the most controversial and unresolved threats aquaculture poses to coastal ecosystems and fisheries. We report a comprehensive analysis of the spread and impact of farm-origin parasites on the survival of wild fish populations. We mathematically coupled extensive data sets of native parasitic sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) transmission and pathogenicity on migratory wild juvenile pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (Oncorhynchus keta) salmon. Farm-origin lice induced 9-95\% mortality in several sympatric wild juvenile pink and chum salmon populations. The epizootics arise through a mechanism that is new to our understanding of emerging infectious diseases: fish farms undermine a functional role of host migration in protecting juvenile hosts from parasites associated with adult hosts. Although the migratory life cycles of Pacific salmon naturally separate adults from juveniles, fish farms provide L. salmonis novel access to juvenile hosts, in this case raising infection rates for at least the first approximately 2.5 months of the salmon's marine life (approximately 80 km of the migration route). Spatial segregation between juveniles and adults is common among temperate marine fishes, and as aquaculture continues its rapid growth, this disease mechanism may challenge the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and economies.},

Benthic samples were collected along transects which ran across the farms, generally from 100 m upstream to 100 m downstream. Sediment deposition, redox values, sediment sulphide concentrations, organic carbon content and water turbidity levels near the bottom were significantly different between the farms but not between sites outside the farm, at the boundary and sites within the farm. Video recordings at one farm showed dense coverage of fine filamentous algae and patchy bacterial mats directly under some longlines and this algae is thought to have fallen off the mussel longlines. At another farm dense beds of seagrass were observed in the videos both under trays of oysters and outside the farm. The benthic infauna did not show clear signs of organic enrichment, and neither univariate nor multivariate measures of benthic infauna were significantly different between sites inside and outside the farm, although they were different between farms. It was concluded from these results that shellfish farming is having little impact, and much less than salmon farming, on the benthic environment in Tasmania.

The objectives of this investigation were to identify quantitative indicators of the effects of aquaculture on marine communities, and to assess their applicability over a range of ecosystems and aquaculture production systems. The study included 6 Mediterranean and 4 Atlantic sites, 7 of which produced finfish (seabream, seabass, tuna, salmon and cod), and 2 bivalve molluscs (oysters, mussels, and clams); one site produced both fish and bivalves. Cultivation methods included finfish cages, long-lines and trestles. Similar sampling methodologies were employed at the 10 study sites, obtaining sediment, hydrodynamic, and benthic faunal data. The horizontal impact from organic enrichment extended 50 m from the farms, with contradictory responses in several indicators (individual abundance, biomass) and a more consistent response of the Infaunal Trophic Index (ITI) and AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). By means of Partial Redundancy Analysis, it was demonstrated that the environmental variables explained 53.2\% of the variability in the macrofaunal variables (individual abundance, species richness, diversity, AMBI and ITI), whilst the explained variance was partialled out within three groups of variables: (i) ‘hydrography' (depth, distance to farm, average current speed), which explained 11.5\% of the variance; (ii) ‘sediment' (Eh and percentages of silt and total organic matter), which explained 5.4\%; and (iii) ‘cages' (years of production and annual production), which explained 15.2\%. The shared variance explained by interactions among these groups was 21.1\%. These results, together with multiple regression analysis, provide an accurate assessment of the degree of impact from aquaculture. In conclusion, the use of several benthic indicators, in assessing farm impacts, together with the investigation of dynamics of the studied location, water depth, years of farm activity, and total annual production, must be included when interpreting the response of benthic communities to organic enrichment from aquaculture.},

In the model, rate expressions describe organic matter oxidation and oxidation of reduced species formed as a product of organic matter oxidation. Organic matter oxidation is broken down into oxic respiration, denitrification, and manganese, iron, and sulfate reduction. Transport processes include advection, molecular diffusion, bioturbation and bioirrigation by benthic macrofauna. Performance of the model was evaluated against the extensive observed data available from Tategami, an area in Ago Bay. Our steady-state calculation reasonably reproduced the year-averaged vertical profile and our dynamic calculation also captured the overall trend of seasonal variation in the concentration of material in the sediment. These results illustrate the validity of our model of early diagenesis. We also found an interesting point that is a discrepancy between the steady-state solution and the year-averaged data obtained using the dynamic calculation. This difference was probably caused by the non-linear nature of the system (non-linear dependency on temperature) and suggests the suitability of dynamic analysis for the sediment in subtropical sea areas such as Ago Bay. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the calculated concentration of materials in the sediment was strongly affected by changes in following parameters: the deposition flux of organic matter and iron hydroxide, transport parameters, Q10 values, and the mineralization rate of dissolved organic matter.},

Sediment cores were incubated in a continuous flowthrough system in which the 02 concen-tration was varied in the overlying water while the NO3-concentration was kept constant. Nitrification was stimulated with increasing 02 concentrations in the overlying water from 0 to 100\% of atmospheric saturation, whereas only a slight stimulation was observed above 100\%. At 02 concentrations below 100\% of atmospheric saturation, NO3-from the overlying water was the most important source of N for denitrification, whereas above 100\% of atmospheric saturation, NO3-produced by nitrification was the main source of N for denitrification. The converse effects of the 02 levels on the source of NO3-can be explained by applying a simple one-dimensional model: 02 in the overlying water controls the diffusional distance of NO3-to the anoxic zone of denitrification and consequently the location of NO3-vertically in the sediment as well as the magnitude of the nitrification activity. Our results suggest that in aquatic environments containing low N03-concentrations in the overlying water (such as coastal waters), higher 02 conditions will stimulate denitrification, while the opposite will occur in systems containing high N03-concentrations (such as eutrophic lakes and streams).},

	abstract = {The effects of fish farm activities on sediment biogeochemistry were investigated in Loch Creran (Western Scotland) from March to October 2006. Sediment oxygen uptake rates (SOU) were estimated along an organic matter gradient generated from an Atlantic salmon farm using a combination of in situ techniques: microelectrodes, planar optode and benthic chamber incubations. Sulphide (H2S) and pH distributions in sediment porewater were also measured using in situ microelectrodes, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes were measured in situ using benthic chambers. Relationships between benthic fluxes, vertical distribution of oxidants and reduced compounds in the sediment were examined as well as bacterial abundance and biomass. Seasonal variations in SOU were relatively low and mainly driven by seasonal temperature variations. The effect of the fish farm on sediment oxygen uptake rate was clearly identified by higher total and diffusive oxygen uptake rates (TOU and DOU, respectively) on impacted stations (TOU: 70 ± 25 mmol O2 m-2 day-1; DOU: 70 ± 32 mmol O2 m-2 day-1 recalculated at the summer temperature), compared with the reference station (TOU: 28.3 ± 5.5 mmol O2 m-2 day-1; DOU: 21.5 ± 4.5 mmol O2 m-2 day-1). At the impacted stations, planar optode images displayed high centimetre scale heterogeneity in oxygen distribution underlining the control of oxygen dynamics by small-scale processes. The organic carbon enrichment led to enhanced sulphate reduction as demonstrated by large vertical H2S concentration gradients in the porewater (from 0 to 1,000 lM in the top 3 cm) at the most impacted site. The impact on ecosystem functions such as bioirrigation was evidenced by a decreasing TOU/DOU ratio, from 1.7 in the non-impacted sediments to 1 in the impacted zone. This trend was related to a shift in the macrofaunal assemblage and an increase in sediment bacterial population.

The focus here is on providing an overview of the most important pools of nitrogen, their transformations, their distribution, and their connection to the cycling of other biogeochemically relevant elements, primarily carbon, oxygen, and phosphorus. The scale is global, as subsequent chapters cover individual ocean basins and systems. The chapter also addresses a series of nitrogen challenges, such as the question of how the marine nitrogen cycle appears to be able to maintain a relatively well-established homeostasis, that is, a balance between gains and losses of fixed nitrogen. Finally, it discusses the anthropogenic perturbation of the marine nitrogen cycle. As it examines, however, the answers to many of these questions remain elusive, reminding us how little we know about the marine nitrogen cycle, and how much still remains to be discovered. Although the marine nitrogen cycle occupies a central role within the biogeochemical cycles of the sea, scientific communities barely begin to its major processes and the factors that regulate them. This occurs at a time when human interventions in the Earth system rise to unprecedented levels, with a particularly strong impact on the global nitrogen cycle.},

	abstract = {Invasive species and bottom-water hypoxia both constitute major global threats to the diversity and integrity of marine ecosystems. These stressors may interact with unexpected consequences, as invasive species that require an initial environmental disturbance to become established can subsequently become important drivers of ecological change. There is recent evidence that improved bottom-water oxygen conditions in coastal areas of the northern Baltic Sea coincide with increased abundances of the invasive polychaetes Marenzelleria spp. Using a reactive-transport model, we demonstrate that the long-term bioirrigation activities of dense Marenzelleria populations have a major impact on sedimentary phosphorus dynamics. This may facilitate the switch from a seasonally hypoxic system back to a normoxic system by reducing the potential for sediment-induced eutrophication in the upper water column. In contrast to short-term laboratory experiments, our simulations, which cover a 10-year period, show that Marenzelleria has the potential to enhance long-term phosphorus retention in muddy sediments. Over time bioirrigation leads to a substantial increase in the iron-bound phosphorus content of sediments while reducing the concentration of labile organic carbon. As surface sediments are maintained oxic, iron oxyhydroxides are able to persist and age into more refractory forms. The model illustrates mechanisms through which Marenzelleria can act as a driver of ecological change, although hypoxic disturbance or natural population declines in native species may be needed for them to initially become established. Invasive species are generally considered to have a negative impact; however, we show here that one of the main recent invaders in the Baltic Sea may provide important ecosystem services. This may be of particular importance in low-diversity systems, where disturbances may dramatically alter ecosystem services due to low functional redundancy. Thus, an environmental problem in one region may be either exacerbated or alleviated by a single species from another region, with potentially ecosystem-wide consequences.},

This system is affected by the discharges of organic carbon and nutrients from the surrounding aquaculture installations. Sediment oxygen uptake rates and inorganic carbon fluxes ranged respectively from 16 to 79??mmol O2 m- 2 d- 1 and from 48 to 146??mmol C m- 2 d- 1. Benthic alkalinity fluxes were corrected for the influence of NH4+ and NO3- + NO2- fluxes, and the upper and lower limits for carbon oxidation rates were inferred by considering two possible scenarios: maximum and minimum contribution of CaCO3 dissolution to corrected alkalinity fluxes. Average Cox rates were in all cases within ?? 25\% of the upper and lower limits and ranged from 40 to 122??mmol C m- 2 d- 1. Whereas carbon mineralization did not show significant differences among the sites, Cox rates varied seasonally and were correlated with temperature (r2 = 0.72). During winter and spring denitrification was estimated to account for an average loss of 46\% and 75\%, respectively, of the potentially recyclable N, whereas during the summer no net removal was observed. A possible shift from denitrification to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) during this period is argued. Dissolved CH4 and N2O fluxes ranged from 5.7 to 47????mol CH4 m- 2 d- 1 and 4.3 to 49????mol N-N2O m- 2 d- 1, respectively, and represented in all cases a small fraction of total inorganic C and N flux. Overall, about 60\% of the total particulate organic matter that is discharged into the creek by the main fish farm facility is estimated to degrade in the sediments, resulting in a significant input of nutrients to the system. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {When cultured Atlantic salmon are released into nature, they compete with wild fish for food, space, and breeding partners. As a result of morphological, physiological, ecological, and behavioural changes that occur in hatcheries, their comp etitive ability often differs from that of wild fish. These changes are partly phenotypic and partly genetic. Cultured juveniles' faster growth rate influences age and size at smolting and maturity, reproductive output, and longevity. Fast-growing parr tend to smolt younger, produce more but smaller eggs, attain maturity earlier, and die younger. Juvenile learning influences a number of behavioural traits, and differences in early experience appear to affect feeding and spawning success, migratory behaviour, and homing ability. Genetic change in hatcheries is chiefly the result of natural selection, with differential mortality among genotypes and broodstock selection based on production traits such as high adult body mass and fast growth rate. Experimental evidence has revealed that cultured parr's greater aggression often allows them to dominate wild parr, although smaller cultured parr can be subordinated if they co-occur in fast-flowing water and if wild smolts have established prior residence. During spawning, the fitness of wild salmon is superior to that of cultured conspecifics. Cultured males are inferior to wild males in intra-sexual competition, courting, and spawning; cultured females have greater egg retention, construct fewer nests, and are less efficient at covering their eggs in the substratum than their wild counterparts. In rivers, the early survival of cultured offspring is lower than that of their wild counterparts. The lifetime reproductive success of farmed fish has been estimated at 17\% that of similar-sized wild salmon. As a result of ecological interaction and through density-dependent mechanisms, cultured fish may displace wild conspecifics to some extent, increase their mortality, and decrease their growth rate, adult size, reproductive output, biomass, and production. © 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

The data collected were analysed by a combination of uni-and multivariate statistical methods. The macrobenthic community at the two stations furthest from the fish cage site showed signs of recovery with time in terms of indicator species, number of species and abundance, being, however, still moderately to slightly disturbed at the end of this study. At the station nearest to the former fish cage site, recovery of the macrobenthic community was also evident, but this station was still highly impacted 15 months after fish production ceased, with opportunistic species dominant. Fifteen months after fallowing, highly reduced conditions were still persistent in subsurface sediments at the stations on the periphery of the former fish cage site. Bulk sediment organic carbon, although an indicator of a spatial gradient, was not found to be a significant indicator of recovery.

	abstract = {The removal of nitrogen (N) in aquatic ecosystems is of great interest because excessive nitrate in groundwater and surface water is a growing problem. High nitrate loading degrades water quality and is linked to eutrophica tion and harmful algal blooms, especially in coastal marine waters. Past research on nitrate removal processes has emphasized plant or microbial uptake (assimilation) or respiratory denitrification by bacteria. The increasing application of stable isotopes and other tracer techniques to the study of nitrate removal has yielded a growing body of evidence for alternative, microbially mediated processes of nitrate transformation. These include dissim ilatory (the reduction of nitrogen into other inorganic compounds, coupled to energy producing processes) reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA), chemoautotrophic denitrification via sulfur or iron oxidation, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), as well as abiotic nitrate removal processes. Here, we review evi dence for the importance of alternative nitrate removal pathways in aquatic ecosystems and discuss how the pos sible prevalence of these pathways may alter views of N cycling and its controls. These alternative pathways are of particular importance for the management of excess N in the environment, especially in cases where nitrate is transformed to ammonium, a biologically available and less mobile N form, rather than to dinitrogen gas.},

	abstract = {The effects of fish farm activities on sediment biogeochemistry were investigated in Loch Creran (Western Scotland) from March to October 2006. Sediment oxygen uptake rates (SOU) were estimated along an organic matter gradient generated from an Atlantic salmon farm using a combination of in situ techniques: microelectrodes, planar optode and benthic chamber incubations. Sulphide (H2S) and pH distributions in sediment porewater were also measured using in situ microelectrodes, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes were measured in situ using benthic chambers. Relationships between benthic fluxes, vertical distribution of oxidants and reduced compounds in the sediment were examined as well as bacterial abundance and biomass. Seasonal variations in SOU were relatively low and mainly driven by seasonal temperature variations. The effect of the fish farm on sediment oxygen uptake rate was clearly identified by higher total and diffusive oxygen uptake rates (TOU and DOU, respectively) on impacted stations (TOU: 70 ± 25 mmol O2 m-2 day-1; DOU: 70 ± 32 mmol O2 m-2 day-1 recalculated at the summer temperature), compared with the reference station (TOU: 28.3 ± 5.5 mmol O2 m-2 day-1; DOU: 21.5 ± 4.5 mmol O2 m-2 day-1). At the impacted stations, planar optode images displayed high centimetre scale heterogeneity in oxygen distribution underlining the control of oxygen dynamics by small-scale processes. The organic carbon enrichment led to enhanced sulphate reduction as demonstrated by large vertical H2S concentration gradients in the porewater (from 0 to 1,000 lM in the top 3 cm) at the most impacted site. The impact on ecosystem functions such as bioirrigation was evidenced by a decreasing TOU/DOU ratio, from 1.7 in the non-impacted sediments to 1 in the impacted zone. This trend was related to a shift in the macrofaunal assemblage and an increase in sediment bacterial population.

The fate of NO2 was related to salinity, perhaps via sulfide effects on DNRA.

An extensive dataset including porewater concentration profiles and in situ benthic fluxes of nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-) and ammonium (NH4+) was used to constrain a 1-D reaction-transport model designed to simulate and interpret the measured data at each station. Simulated rates of nitrification, denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) by filamentous large sulfur bacteria (e.g. Beggiatoa and Thioploca) were highly variable throughout the OMZ yet clear trends were discernible. On the shelf and upper slope (80-260m water depth) where extensive areas of bacterial mats were present, DNRA dominated total N turnover (???2.9mmolNm-2d-1) and accounted for ???65\% of NO3-+NO2- uptake by the sediments from the bottom water. Nonetheless, these sediments did not represent a major sink for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN=NO3-+NO2-+NH4+) since DNRA reduces NO3- and, potentially NO2-, to NH4+. Consequently, the shelf and upper slope sediments were recycling sites for DIN due to relatively low rates of denitrification and high rates of ammonium release from DNRA and ammonification of organic matter. This finding contrasts with the current opinion that sediments underlying OMZs are a strong sink for DIN. Only at greater water depths (300-1000m) did the sediments become a net sink for DIN. Here, denitrification was the major process (???2mmolNm-2d-1) and removed 55-73\% of NO3- and NO2- taken up by the sediments, with DNRA and anammox accounting for the remaining fraction. Anammox was of minor importance on the shelf and upper slope yet contributed up to 62\% to total N2 production at the 1000m station. The results indicate that the partitioning of oxidized N (NO3-, NO2-) into DNRA or denitrification is a key factor determining the role of marine sediments as DIN sinks or recycling sites. Consequently, high measured benthic uptake rates of oxidized N within OMZs do not necessarily indicate a loss of fixed N from the marine environment. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Respiratory reduction of nitrate (denitrification) is recognized as the most important process converting biologically available (fixed) nitrogen to N2. In current N cycle models, a major proportion of global marine denitrification (50–70\%) is assumed to take place on the sea floor, particularly in organic rich continental margin sediments. Recent observations indicate that present conceptual views of denitrification and pathways of nitrate reduction and N2 formation are incomplete. Alternative N cycle pathways, particularly in sediments, include anaerobic ammonium oxidation to nitrite, nitrate and N2 by Mn-oxides, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction and subsequent N2 mobilization. The discovery of new links and feedback mechanisms between the redox cycles of, e.g., C, N, S, Mn and Fe casts doubt on the present general understanding of the global N cycle. Recent models of the oceanic N budget indicate that total inputs are significantly smaller than estimated fixed N removal. The occurrence of alternative N reaction pathways further exacerbates the apparent imbalance as they introduce additional routes of N removal. In this contribution, we give a brief historical background of the conceptual understanding of N cycling in marine ecosystems, emphasizing pathways of aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization in marine sediments, and the implications of recently recognized metabolic pathways for N removal in marine environments.},

After this farm began operating, there was a significant doubling in mean wet NH4 + concentrations (465–1,022 μg l−1) at 0.8 km with no change at the other sites. To measure the phytoplankton responses to nutrient enrichment, we conducted seasonal N and P enrichment bioassays from 2006 to 2008 on nearby Phelps Lake and Alligator River. These low-nutrient waters responded to nutrient additions, with the highest increases in phytoplankton primary productivity (14C uptake) and biomass (chlorophyll a) occurring in the combined N and P treatments suggesting co-limitation of N and P. Although we did not find an increased nutrient signal in precipitation at sites {\textbackslash}textgreater0.8 km from the farm, there is the potential for atmospheric deposition of N to these and other waters located N/NE of the farm given prevailing winds and distance that NH4 + aerosols can travel. Furthermore, surface runoff from the farm may impact receiving waters downstream (e.g., Pungo and Pamlico Rivers). In order to prevent excessive phytoplankton productivity and biomass both N and P inputs should be carefully assessed and potentially controlled in these nutrient-sensitive waters.},

The macrobenthos indicated a slower recovery than chemical measures, after 36 months the benthic faunal community structure under the cages still differed from reference conditions even though other sediment measures had recovered.

Sediment chemistry and meiofaunal assemblages were investigated from July 1997 to February 1998 on a monthly basis at two stations: the first was located under the fish farm, while the second was at about 1 km distance, and served as control. Variations in the biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter and meiofaunal community structure were also related to changes in reared fish biomass. The presence of the cage-induced rapid changes in the benthic compartment: the sediments reached rapidly (i.e., after only 6 weeks) reducing conditions. A significant accumulation of biopolymeric carbon was observed beneath the cage both at the beginning of this study and 5-7 months after cage disposal and appeared to be related to the fish-farm production cycle. Sedimentary proteins and lipids resulted to be good descriptors of medium-term fish-farm impact. Changes in the sediment conditions beneath the cage determined a significant reduction of the total meiofaunal density (on average for 70\%). Most meiofaunal taxa, including nematodes, copepods and ostracods displayed a significant decrease in the farm sediments within 3 months after cage installation. Kinorhynchs appeared extremely sensitive to reducing conditions of the sediments and disappeared almost completely, whereas polychaete densities remained unvaried. After initial impact meiofaunal assemblages responded to organic enrichment recovering, at least partially, their apparent structural characteristics. These data indicate that studies carried out several months after cage deployment might underestimate the actual impact on benthic assemblages. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fixed nitrogen limits primary productivity in many parts of the global ocean, and it consequently plays a role in controlling the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. The concentration of fixed nitrogen is determined by the balance between two processes: the fixation of nitrogen gas into organic forms by diazotrophs, and the reconversion of fixed nitrogen to nitrogen gas by denitrifying organisms. However, current sedimentary denitrification rates are poorly constrained, especially in permeable sediments, which cover the majority of the continental margin. Also, anammox has recently been shown to be an additional pathway for the loss of fixed nitrogen in sediments. This article briefly reviews sedimentary fixed nitrogen loss by sedimentary denitrification and anammox, including in sediments in contact with oxygen-deficient zones. A simple extrapolation of existing rate measurements to the global sedimentary denitrification rate yields a value smaller than many existing measurement-based estimates but still larger than the rate of water column denitrification.},

	abstract = {Organic enrichment of sediments underlying fish farms in temperate and trop- ical coastal zones is reviewed to identify similarities and important biogeochemical differences. Improvements in technology have allowed farms to move from depositional sites to more erosional offshore locations. However, low cost farms are still being located in sheltered areas, in particular in the tropics. Important differences in the response of sediment geochemical variables to organic enrichment are associated with finfish aqua- culture located under highly diverse hydrographic and sedimentological conditions in different coastal areas. In temperate latitudes where farms are often located over soft bottom, organic enrichment increases sediment microbial activity and may alter benthic community structure. Enhanced anaerobic activity may lead to accumulation of sulfides with adverse effects on aerobic bacteria, plants and fauna due to progressive oxygen de- pletion. In warm temperate waters, such as the Mediterranean and tropical latitudes, many farms are located in more advective areas with coarse-grained carbonate-rich sediments. Effects of organic enrichment in these areas are less well described, but studies have also shown sulfide accumulation in sediments indicative of deteriorated benthic habitats.},

The integrated model was applied to a salmon fish farm located in a Scottish fjordic sealoch. The major diagenetic processes of the reaction network were first identified on the basis of literature information and his- toric data. Next, the organic carbon (OC) flux at a pristine site near the farm was estimated by fitting the vertical profiles of pore water and solid-state chemical species measured in the field. DEPOMOD was then used to predict the fluxes of OC due to the release of uneaten feed and faeces at various dis- tances away from the farm. These fluxes were added to the background ‘natural' fluxes and used as forcing functions for the RTM. Comparison of the simulated transient profiles with data collected at an impacted site revealed that the RTM model satisfactorily predicted the transient dynamics of the system. We discuss the use of the model for cost-effective environmental impact assessments, site selection and the optimization of husbandry practices.},

	abstract = {Environmental impacts of salmon cage aquaculture resulting from deposition of organic-rich particulate matter to the sea bottom have been thought to be a function of the local environmental conditions and management practices. However, testing of these suppositions have been limited by (1) widely varying monitoring methods employed, and (2) lack of data comparability resulting from the absence of standardized national monitoring schemes. In order to determine the sensitivity of different monitoring methods in detecting benthic environmental effects, a comparative analysis was undertaken of four methods commonly employed in Norway that vary in cost and expertise required: (1) visual diver surveys, (2) faunal analysis, (3) sediment chemistry, and (4) Sediment Profile Imagery (SPI). Results indicate that all methods agreed in the common "impact zone" under and immediately next to the cages. However, each of the methods differed in their sensitivity in detecting more subtle effects at greater distances from the cages. Data from 168 environmental survey samples located at various distances from working Norwegian salmon cage farms collected using similar methodology between 1996 and 1998 were analyzed to determine the relationship between environmental variables, management regimes, and levels of environmental impact. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels in sediments were significantly higher immediately adjacent to cages compared to reference sites, and approximately 32\% of the samples under the cages showed significant degradation. At intermediate distances (50-100 m), influences from fish farming are not clearly detected by TOC analysis. Further, while neither depth nor current speed alone are good predictors for environmental management, the results suggest recovery of sites by periodic abandonment (or fallowing) is one of the best management tools for sustainable salmon farming in cold-water environments. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In the Firth of Thames, New Zealand, there are more than 2000??ha of existing and approved farm area with applications pending for approximately another 6000??ha, however, no previous studies have examined the impacts of mussel culture in this region. To determine the impact of a mussel farm (45??ha) in the Firth of Thames we measured sedimentation rates by deploying sediment traps, sediment characteristics by collecting sediment cores and sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes by deploying benthic chambers in four seasons. Sedimentation under the farm was increased by 106??g m- 2 d- 1 compared to the reference site. Similarly sediments under the farm had elevated organic carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll a and phaeopigment concentrations indicative of the additional organic input due to bivalve biodeposition. Oxygen consumption was higher under the farm compared to a reference site (1.1-2.1??) but this increase was only significant (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) in summer when rates reached 3083????mol m- 2 h- 1 under the farm. Ammonia release rates ranged from 80 to 319????mol m- 2 h- 1 and were higher under the farm compared to the reference site in spring (1.8??, non-significant p = 0.588) and autumn (3??, significant p = 0.006) but in summer release rates at the reference site (275????mol m- 2 h- 1) were 1.4?? higher than those under the farm. Nitrate fluxes (3.1 to 21.8????mol m- 2 h- 1) were significantly (p = 0.001) higher at the farm site. Oxygen and nutrient fluxes generally demonstrated the typical response to increased organic input due to sedimentation from mussel culture. Unusually low nitrogen release rates in summer may indicate enhanced denitrification under the farm. Benthic regeneration at the reference site could supply 74\% of nitrogen required by pelagic primary producers whereas under the farm it could account for 94\%. This demonstrates the importance of benthic nutrient regeneration in this region and that mussel culture can lead to a redistribution of nutrients. The farm we studied is small and located in a high-energy environment and impacts from larger farms or in areas where biodeposit dispersal is limited are likely to be even more significant and we suggest that site-specific hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions have to be taken into account when planning new mussel farms to prevent excessive modifications of nutrient dynamics. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas several studies, primarily of epifaunal bivalves, have assessed denitrification, few have considered nutrient regeneration processes such as dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which competes with denitrification for nitrate and results in nitrogen retention rather than loss. This study compares sediment nitrogen cycling including mineralization, DNRA, and denitrification within U.S. clam aquaculture sediments to nearby uncultivated sediments, seasonally. Clam aquaculture significantly increased sediment ammonium and phosphate effluxes relative to uncultivated sediments. Both DNRA and denitrification were significantly enhanced at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments in July and November, while in May only DNRA was increased. The ratio of DNRA to denitrification was significantly higher at clam beds compared to uncultivated sediments, demonstrating that DNRA may be favored due to a ready supply of labile organic carbon relative to nitrate and perhaps sulfidic conditions. Functional gene abundances, nrfA (DNRA) and nirS (denitrification) followed similar patterns to nitrate respiration rates with highest nrfA abundances in the clam sediments and similar nirS abundances across seasons and sediment type. Ultimately clam sediments were found to be a significant source of nutrients to the water column whereas uncultivated sediments retained ammonium produced by microbial mineralization. Thus, clam cultivation may promote local eutrophication (i.e., increased primary production) by facilitating nutrient regeneration and retention of ammonium in the sediments.},

	volume = {64},
	abstract = {Oceanographers noticed already many years ago that far less ammonium accumulated in anoxic fjords and basins, than would be expected from the stoichiometry of heterotrophic denitrification. It was suggested that this 'missing' ammonium was oxidized with nitrate to free N(2). Since then several other workers have argued based on chemical profiles that ammonium is oxidized anaerobically in oxygen deficient marine sediments and waters with either nitrate or manganese oxides as electron acceptor. While there is as yet no direct evidence for the anaerobic ammonium oxidation with manganese oxides in either sediments or anoxic water columns, more and more evidence is being provided for anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite/nitrate. The first direct evidence for the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium was provided in a waste water bioreactor, where so-called 'anammox' bacteria belonging to the Order Planctomycetales directly oxidize ammonium to N(2) with nitrite as the electron acceptor. Although the anammox process was generally seen as a promising process for waste water treatment. it was believed to be insignificant in the natural environment due to the extremely slow generation times (more than 2 weeks) of the anammox organisms. However, recent studies provide direct evidence for anaerobic oxidation of ammonium by nitrate and/or nitrite in marine sediments, oxygen minimum zones, anoxic fjords and basins as well as Arctic sea ice. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences show that the bacteria involved are closely related to anammox bacteria from waste water bioreactors. The combined biogeochemical and microbiological data available indicates that anammox may contribute significantly to the loss of reactive nitrogen in the ocean.},

	abstract = {Organisms with the denitrification capacity are widely distributed and in high density in nature. It is not well understood why they are so successful. A survey of denitrifying enzyme content of various habitats is presented which indicates a role of carbon and oxygen, but not nitrate, in affecting denitrifier populations. It is suggested that organic carbon is more important than oxygen status in determining denitrifying enzyme content of habitats. In low oxygen environments, denitrifiers compete with organisms that dissimilate nitrate to ammonium, a process which conserves nitrogen. The energetic and kinetic parameters that affect this competition are evaluated. The latter is examined using Michaelis-Menten theoretical models by varying Vmax, Km, and So (substrate concentration) for the two competing populations. The outcome predicted by these models is presented and discussed in relation to previous data on population densities and Km values for representatives of these competing groups. These models suggest the conditions required to achieve changes in partitioning between the two fates of nitrate. These considerations are important if one is to be able to evaluate and successfully "manage" the fate of nitrate in any habitat.},

	abstract = {In the rice soils, the alternate wetting and drying conditions and the leakage of O-2 from rice roots provides a favorable environment for many N transformation processes, such as DNRA, nitrification, mineralization, and denitrification. Since nitrification is an inevitable process providing available NO3 (-) for DNRA and other NO3 (-) loss pathways, it is logical to hypothesize that a relationship exists between nitrification and DNRA. Thus, we quantified the specific gross N transformation rates occurring simultaneously to investigate the correlation among the N transformation rates in the rice soil. In this study, three rice soils with different pH values were selected. The combination of N-15 tracing experiment and numerical modeling method was performed to quantify the specific gross N transformation rates (e.g., DNRA), to analyze the correlation between DNRA and the other N transformations, and to estimate the functional role of DNRA comparing to other N transformation in the rice soil. The results showed that there were two NH4 (+) production pathways, organic N mineralization and DNRA, in the neutral (pH 6.2) and alkaline (pH 8.2) soils, while the DNRA process was negligible in acidic soil (pH 4.7). The mineralization rate in the acidic soil (2.69 mg kg(-1)d(-1)) was significantly higher than that in neutral and alkaline soils. The DNRA rate was 0.48 and 1.09 mg kg(-1)d(-1), which was almost equal to the mineralization rate, in the neutral (pH 6.2) and alkaline (pH 8.2) soils, offsetting efficiently the effect of low mineralization on N availability in ecosystems. The DNRA rate linearly increased with the increase in gross nitrification rate (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). This significant coupling relationship between DNRA and nitrification favors N conservation and availability for paddy growth in the rice ecosystem. DNRA plays an important role in soil N conservation and availability in neutral and alkaline but not acidic rice soil.},

However, minor differences were still evident, along with some on-going benthic instability, attributable to medium-scale spatial movements and successional patterns of macrobenthos. Quantifying the endpoint of 'recovery' proved challenging due to: lack of a widely accepted definition, inherent variability in recovering sediments, differing trajectories of impact and reference sites, and statistical challenges. More complex biotic indices and metrics incorporating multiple variables were the most robust indicators. Statistical tests for 'parallelism' in the trajectories of Cage and Reference sites proved useful, but results were contingent upon how the method was applied, and should therefore be used in conjunction with data-visualisation methods. The study highlights the importance of a predetermined recovery endpoint, and using multiple indicators and a weight-of-evidence assessment approach.},

Rates of NH4+ and Sigma CO2 liberation sediment incubations were used with O2 penetration depths to conclude that O2 respiration accounted for only between 3.6-17.4\% of the total organic carbon oxidation. Dentrification was limited to a narrow zone just below the depth of O2 penetration, and was not a major carbon oxidation pathway. The processes of Fe reduction, Mn reduction and sulfate reduction dominated organic carbon mineralization, but their relative significance varied depending on the sediment. Where high concentrations of Mn-oxide were found (3-4 wt\% Mn), only Mn reduction occurred. With lower Mn oxide concentrations more typical of coastal sediments, Fe reduction and sulfate reduction were most important and of a similar magnitude. Overall, most of the measured O2 flux into the sediment was used to oxidized reduced inorganic species and not organic carbon. We suspect that the importance of O2 respiration in many coastal sediments has been overestimated, whereas metal oxide reduction (both Fe and Mn reduction) has probably been well underestimated.},

	abstract = {The relative importance of two dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways, denitrification (DEN) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), was investigated in intact sediment cores from five different coastal marine field sites (Dorum, Aarhus Bight, Mississippi Delta, Limfjord and Janssand). The vertical distribution of DEN activity was examined using the acetylene inhibition technique combined with N2O microsensor measurements, whereas NH4+ production via DNRA was measured with a recently developed gel probe-stable isotope technique. At all field sites, dissimilatory nitrate reduction was clearly dominated by DEN (59–131\% of the total NO3− reduced) rather than by DNRA, irrespective of the sedimentary inventories of electron donors such as organic carbon, sulfide, and iron. Highest ammonium production via DNRA, accounting for up to 8.9\% of the total NO3− reduced, was found at a site with very high concentrations of total sulfide and NH4+ within and below the layer in which NO3− reduction occurred. Sediment from two field sites, one with low and one with high DNRA activity in the core incubations, was also used for slurry incubations. Now, in both sediments high DNRA activity was detected accounting for 37–77\% of the total NO3− reduced. These contradictory results might be explained by enhanced NO3− availability for DNRA bacteria in the sediment slurries compared to the core-incubated sediments in which diffusion of NO3− from the water column may only reach DEN bacteria, but not DNRA bacteria. The true partitioning of dissimilatory nitrate reduction between DNRA and DEN may thus lie in between the values found in whole core (underestimation of DNRA) and slurry incubations (overestimation of DNRA).},

	abstract = {Nutrient measurements indicate that 30-50\% of the total nitrogen (N) loss in the ocean occurs in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). This pelagic N-removal takes place within only ∼0.1\% of the ocean volume, hence moderate variations in the extent of OMZs due to global warming may have a large impact on the global N-cycle. We examined the effect of oxygen (O(2)) on anammox, NH(3) oxidation and NO(3)(-) reduction in (15)N-labeling experiments with varying O(2) concentrations (0-25 µmol L(-1)) in the Namibian and Peruvian OMZs. Our results show that O(2) is a major controlling factor for anammox activity in OMZ waters. Based on our O(2) assays we estimate the upper limit for anammox to be ∼20 µmol L(-1). In contrast, NH(3) oxidation to NO(2)(-) and NO(3)(-) reduction to NO(2)(-) as the main NH(4)(+) and NO(2)(-) sources for anammox were only moderately affected by changing O(2) concentrations. Intriguingly, aerobic NH(3) oxidation was active at non-detectable concentrations of O(2), while anaerobic NO(3)(-) reduction was fully active up to at least 25 µmol L(-1) O(2). Hence, aerobic and anaerobic N-cycle pathways in OMZs can co-occur over a larger range of O(2) concentrations than previously assumed. The zone where N-loss can occur is primarily controlled by the O(2)-sensitivity of anammox itself, and not by any effects of O(2) on the tightly coupled pathways of aerobic NH(3) oxidation and NO(3)(-) reduction. With anammox bacteria in the marine environment being active at O(2) levels ∼20 times higher than those known to inhibit their cultured counterparts, the oceanic volume potentially acting as a N-sink increases tenfold. The predicted expansion of OMZs may enlarge this volume even further. Our study provides the first robust estimates of O(2) sensitivities for processes directly and indirectly connected with N-loss. These are essential to assess the effects of ocean de-oxygenation on oceanic N-cycling.},

	abstract = {Fixed nitrogen limits primary productivity in many parts of the global ocean, and it consequently plays a role in controlling the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. The concentration of fixed nitrogen is determined by the balance between two processes: the fixation of nitrogen gas into organic forms by diazotrophs, and the reconversion of fixed nitrogen to nitrogen gas by denitrifying organisms. However, current sedimentary denitrification rates are poorly constrained, especially in permeable sediments, which cover the majority of the continental margin. Also, anammox has recently been shown to be an additional pathway for the loss of fixed nitrogen in sediments. This article briefly reviews sedimentary fixed nitrogen loss by sedimentary denitrification and anammox, including in sediments in contact with oxygen-deficient zones. A simple extrapolation of existing rate measurements to the global sedimentary denitrification rate yields a value smaller than many existing measurement-based estimates but still larger than the rate of water column denitrification.},

	abstract = {The relative impact on macrofaunal diversity of 7 naturally co-occurring bioturbators has been examined in a benthic mesocosm experiment. The bioturbators chosen were selected because of their potential vulnerability to the disturbances associated with demersal trawling. The experiment was conducted at the Solbergstrand mesocosm (Norwegian Institute for Water Research) using subtidal sediment collected from Bjørnehodebukta, a small sheltered bay in the Oslofjord. For 3 of the bioturbating species (Brissopsis lyrifera, Aphrodita aculeata and Amphiura chiajei) a positive, linear relationship was demonstrated between bioturbator abundance and measures of species richness (number of species and Margalef species richness). It was suggested that the presence of these bioturbating species increased oxygen penetration into the sediment, leading to an enhancement in the ability of benthic systems to process organic material. This had a beneficial effect on the associated fauna in terms of maintaining levels of diversity. For Nephtys caeca, highest species diversity was seen in the low abundance treatments. Predation by N. caeca on small polychaetes is proposed as a possible explanation of the lower diversity in high-density treatments. It is concluded that B. lyrifera, A. aculeata, A. chiajei and N. caeca are functionally similar with respect to setting the diversity of the associated macrobenthic community and may therefore fulfill the same role within the benthic ecosystem. The presence of Calocaris macandreae, Nuculana minuta and Astarte sulcata had no detectable effect on diversity. Trawling has been shown to reduce the abundance of bioturbating species, and the current study demonstrates important implications of this loss on the maintenance of diversity. In addition, the interactions between bioturbation, diversity and organic enrichment highlight the need for management of anthropogenic impacts within the coastal environment in a holistic way rather than by isolation.},

The focus here is on providing an overview of the most important pools of nitrogen, their transformations, their distribution, and their connection to the cycling of other biogeochemically relevant elements, primarily carbon, oxygen, and phosphorus. The scale is global, as subsequent chapters cover individual ocean basins and systems. The chapter also addresses a series of nitrogen challenges, such as the question of how the marine nitrogen cycle appears to be able to maintain a relatively well-established homeostasis, that is, a balance between gains and losses of fixed nitrogen. Finally, it discusses the anthropogenic perturbation of the marine nitrogen cycle. As it examines, however, the answers to many of these questions remain elusive, reminding us how little we know about the marine nitrogen cycle, and how much still remains to be discovered. Although the marine nitrogen cycle occupies a central role within the biogeochemical cycles of the sea, scientific communities barely begin to its major processes and the factors that regulate them. This occurs at a time when human interventions in the Earth system rise to unprecedented levels, with a particularly strong impact on the global nitrogen cycle.},

	abstract = {Being an essentially open system, cages are usually characterized by a high degree of interaction with environment and cage systems are highly likely to produce large bulk of wastes that are released directly into the environment. Therefore, large-scale cage aquaculture development has been put into question and concerns have been raised that cage aquaculture produces large bulk of wastes that are rich in organic matter and nutrients and are released into coastal and nearshore environment. Recent information on cage aquaculture nutrient budget is scarce and most published reports are dated. This paper reviews cage aquaculture nutrient budget and nutrient loadings and propose a model for nutrient (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) budget in a hypothetical cage aquaculture farm with values of feed loss, FCR (feed conversion ratio) and nutrient contents in feed and fish taken from published literature in order to calculate the amount (kg) of N and P produced and released to the environment for each ton of fish produced. The paper proposes, in addition, a critically analyzed nutrient budget based on the dry matter conversion rate instead of the usual feed conversion rate. The conceptual model shows that 132.5 kg N and 25.0 kg P are released to the environment for each ton of fish produced; these values are as high as 462.5 kg N and 80.0 kg P when calculated on the basis of dry matter conversion rate instead of usual feed conversion rate. Thus, the annual global N and P loadings from cage aquaculture (10,000 tons fish and 3000 tons dry matter) are 1325 tons N and 250 tons P and 1387.5 tons N and 240.0 tons P based on usual feed conversion rate and dry matter conversion rate respectively. The paper also proposes, by analyzing the existing data, an FCR-based regression model for predicting nutrient loadings for a given diet. Finally, attempt was made to calculate the annual global loading and release of N and P from cage aquaculture to the coastal and marine environment, the potential impacts of nutrient loading on the ecosystem were discussed and critical points to be considered for minimizing nutrient output in cage aquaculture were suggested. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Macrofaunal community structure, abundance and biomass were examined at stations with varying quantities and qualities of organic matter input. In situ benthic chambers were used to determine oxygen and nutrient fluxes and mixing parameters were derived from down core profiles of chlorophyll a (chl a). Mean oxygen demand of sediments ranged between 8.8 and 467.8 mmol m-2 day-1, being highest beneath the fish farm and indicating very high rates of community respiration and organic matter diagenesis. Oxygen and nutrient fluxes followed similar trends to community abundance and biomass, declining with increasing distance from the farm. Mixing intensity increased with distance from the farm until returning, at the farthest station, to values similar to those measured beneath the farm. The differences in the community structure between sediments beneath the farm and furthest from it suggest that similar diffusive mixing coefficients are generated by different mechanisms.

	doi = {10.3354/meps315151},
	abstract = {The influences of suspended mussel and infaunal clam cultivation on benthic metabolism and nutrient cycling were compared in Goro lagoon, Italy. Both aquaculture types stimulated benthic metabolism, with sediment oxygen demand (SOD), CO2 and ammonium effluxes of up to 14, 16 and 1.2 mmol m-2 h-1. However, whilst mussel farming preferentially stimulated anaerobic metabolism and sediment reduction, clam farming did not. The mussel ropes were also large oxygen sinks and ammonium sources, with oxygen consumption and ammonium production rates of 1.4 to 1.5 and 0.18 to 0.43 mmol kg-1 h-1. Consequently, the overall impacts of mussel farming on oxygen and nutrient dynamics were much greater than those of clam farming. There were also differences in nitrate-reduction processes and the nitrate sources that fuelled them. In winter, at high water column nitrate concentrations, highest nitrate reduction rates (∼320 mmol m-2 h-1) occurred at the mussel farm. Nitrate reduction was driven predominantly by water column nitrate and ∼30\% of nitrate reduced was recycled to ammonium via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). At the control and clam farm sites, nitrate reduction rates were lower (∼180 mmol m-2 h-1), nitrification supplied ∼30\% of nitrate and denitrification was dominant. In summer under low nitrate conditions, nitrate reduction was highest (∼130 mmol m-2 h-1) at the mussel farm site, but this activity was completely dependent upon water column nitrate and 95\% of nitrate was reduced via DNRA. In contrast, at the clam farm station, DNRA was unimportant and nitrification was the major nitrate source for denitrification. Consequently, whilst nitrate reduction processes eliminated fixed N from the clam farm sediments via coupled nitrification-denitrification, the dominance of DNRA at the mussel farm site resulted in a net N input to the sediment compartment. These large differences in the impacts of clam and mussel farming can be explained by the fact that infaunal clams stimulate transfer of both organic matter and oxygen to the sediment, whereas suspended mussels enhance only organic matter inputs.},

We investigated the metazoan meiofaunal response to fish-farm impact in four regions of the Mediterranean Sea. Meiofaunal assemblages were investigated in two habitats (seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica and non-vegetated soft bottoms) comparing sites receiving faeces and uneaten food pellets from fish farms to control sites. We report here that, consistently across different regions, the meiofaunal abundance typically responded positively to fish-farm effluents. Biodeposition caused also significant changes in assemblage structure and the reduction in the richness of higher meiofaunal taxa, but the multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the effects were region- and habitat-specific. In non-vegetated systems, three of the four regions investigated displayed significant effects of the fish farms on richness of meiofaunal taxa. In vegetated habitats, meiofauna did not respond to biodeposition (except in one region), suggesting that seagrass meadows can mask the effects of fish-farm effluents on benthic biodiversity. We conclude that different indicators of fish-farm impact are needed in vegetated and non-vegetated benthic systems.},

	abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances. Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen. The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},

The presence of the cages induced a significant accumulation of proteins, lipids and biopolymeric carbon, resulting in a reduction in meiofaunal density at the impacted stations. Changes in community structure were also evident, as meiofauna under the cages were characterized by increased importance of polychaetes and copepods in comparison with a much lower importance of gastrotrichs and kinorynchs. Moreover, biodiversity decreased beneath the cages due to the disappearance of taxa more sensitive to organic accumulation. This finding allowed us to propose the ration of nematodes to kinorynchs as a possible, potentially interesting, indicator of fish farm biodeposition.},

	abstract = {Benthic oxygen and nutrient fluxes and nitrate reduction rates were determined seasonally under light and dark conditions at three sites in a micro-tidal creek within an urbanised catchment (Saltwater Creek, Australia). It was hypothesized that stormwater inputs of organic matter and inorganic nitrogen would stimulate rates of benthic metabolism and nutrient recycling and preferentially stimulate dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) over denitrification as a pathway for nitrate reduction. Stormwaters greatly influenced water column dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and suspended solids concentrations with values following a large rainfall event being 5-20-fold greater than during the preceding dry period. Seasonally, maximum and minimum water column total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) and DIN concentrations occurred in the summer (wet) and winter (dry) seasons. Creek sediments were highly heterotrophic throughout the year, and strong sinks for oxygen, and large sources of dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen during both light and dark incubations, although micro-phytobenthos (MPB) significantly decreased oxygen consumption and N-effluxes during light incubations due to photosynthetic oxygen production and photoassimilation of nutrients. Benthic denitrification rates ranged from 3.5 to 17.7μmolNm2h-1, denitrification efficiencies were low ({\textbackslash}textless1-15\%) and denitrification was a minor process compared to DNRA, which accounted for ∼75\% of total nitrate reduction. Overall, due to the low denitrification efficiencies and high rates of N-regeneration, Saltwater Creek sediments would tend to increase rather than reduce dissolved nutrient loads to the downstream Gold Coast Broadwater and Moreton Bay systems. This may be especially true during wet periods when increased inputs of particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and suspended solids could respectively enhance rates of N-regeneration and decrease light availability to MPB, reducing their capacity to ameliorate N-effluxes through photoassimilation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	title = {Anaerobic ammonium oxidation in the marine environment},
	volume = {64},
	abstract = {Oceanographers noticed already many years ago that far less ammonium accumulated in anoxic fjords and basins, than would be expected from the stoichiometry of heterotrophic denitrification. It was suggested that this 'missing' ammonium was oxidized with nitrate to free N(2). Since then several other workers have argued based on chemical profiles that ammonium is oxidized anaerobically in oxygen deficient marine sediments and waters with either nitrate or manganese oxides as electron acceptor. While there is as yet no direct evidence for the anaerobic ammonium oxidation with manganese oxides in either sediments or anoxic water columns, more and more evidence is being provided for anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite/nitrate. The first direct evidence for the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium was provided in a waste water bioreactor, where so-called 'anammox' bacteria belonging to the Order Planctomycetales directly oxidize ammonium to N(2) with nitrite as the electron acceptor. Although the anammox process was generally seen as a promising process for waste water treatment. it was believed to be insignificant in the natural environment due to the extremely slow generation times (more than 2 weeks) of the anammox organisms. However, recent studies provide direct evidence for anaerobic oxidation of ammonium by nitrate and/or nitrite in marine sediments, oxygen minimum zones, anoxic fjords and basins as well as Arctic sea ice. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences show that the bacteria involved are closely related to anammox bacteria from waste water bioreactors. The combined biogeochemical and microbiological data available indicates that anammox may contribute significantly to the loss of reactive nitrogen in the ocean.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews the factors regulating sediment N-cycling, both in the bulk sediment environment and on a process level. N availability is frequently cited as the factor limiting primary production in marine systems over annual time scales though phosphorus (P), silica (Si) limitation or colimitation by N, P, and/or Si sometimes occur on seasonal time scales. In offshore waters, the presence of bioavailable iron can also regulate primary productivity, particularly that by diatoms. Sediment N pools reflect a balance between inputs (external or internal) and outputs (sedimentation, denitrification (DNF), long-term burial, or export), and this balance is affected by a variety of environmental and physiological factors. Within the sediment, N is cycled primarily by microbially mediated redox reactions between more highly oxidized forms (nitrate, NO3-, or nitrite, NO2-) and more reduced forms (ammonium, NH4-, amino acids, or organic nitrogen compounds). Gaseous products of these redox reactions may include dinitrogen, N2, nitric oxide, NO, and nitrous oxide, N2O. One characteristic of the sediment N-cycle is the coupling between aerobic and anaerobic processes. Another characteristic is that for a given species, for example, NO3-, several competing pathways and potential fates may exist. ?? 2008 Copyright ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved..},

	abstract = {The combined influences of intensive mussel aquaculture and watershed nutrient inputs on nitrogen dynamics in Tracadie Bay, Prince Edward Island, Canada, were examined using a nitrogen budget and an ecosystem model. Budget calculations, and inputs and parameters for the model were based on extensive field data. Both approaches showed that mussel aquaculture has a dominant influence on all aspects of the nitrogen cycle and dramatically alters pathways by which nitrogen reaches the phytoplankton and benthos. A large proportion of phytoplankton production is supported by land-derived nitrogen and this anthropogenic input is important for sustaining existing levels of mussel production. The amount of nitrogen removed in the mussel harvest is small compared with agricultural nitrogen inputs and the amounts of excreted and biodeposited on the seabed. Mussel biodeposition greatly increases the flux of nitrogen to the benthos, with potentially serious eutrophication impacts. Results from the observation-based nitrogen budget and dynamic model were compared and both support the above conclusions. However, the ability of the model to test different scenarios and to provide additional information (e.g. fluxes) over a finer spatial scale led to insights unattainable with a nitrogen budget. For example, food appears to be less available to mussels at the head of the Bay than at the mouth, despite the lower density of grow-out sites in the former location. The number of fundamental ecosystem processes influenced by the mussels and the complexity of their interactions make it difficult to predict the effects of mussels on many ecosystem properties without resorting to a model.},

As expected, both the penetration of oxygen into, and consumption of oxygen by, the sediment decreased by 42 and 46 \%, respectively, once hypoxia was established. Importantly, the oxygen regime did not change significantly (P {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.05) during the experiment, suggesting that organic carbon was not depleted. During the first 10 days, the exchange of NO3 (-), NO2 (-) and NH4 (+) between the sediment and water was erratic but once a steady state was established the sediment acted as either a sink for fixed nitrogen under hypoxia or as a source in the controls. Over the course of the mesocosm experiment the rate of both anammox and denitrification increased, with anammox increasing disproportionately under hypoxia relative to the controls, whereas the rate of increase in denitrification was the same for both. Under sustained hypoxia the production of N-2 gas increased by 72 \% relative to the controls, with this increase in N-2 production remaining constant regardless of the duration of hypoxia. Longer periods of stratification and oxygen depletion are predicted to occur more regularly in the bottom waters of shallow coastal seas as one manifestation of climate change. Under sustained hypoxia the potential for nitrogen removal by the production of N-2 gas in this region of the southern North Sea was estimated to increase from 2.1 kt N 150 days(-1) to 3.6 kt 150 days(-1), while the efflux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ceased altogether; both of which could down regulate the productivity of this region as a whole.},

Monthly experiments were conducted in triplicate in polymictic Wascana Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, during July, August, and September 2008 using large ({\textbackslash}textgreater 3140 liters) enclosures. Addition of all forms of N added at 6 mg N L-1 increased total algal abundance (as chlorophyll a) by up to 350\% relative to controls during August and September, when soluble reactive P (SRP) was {\textbackslash}textgreater 50 mu g P L-1 and dissolved N: P was {\textbackslash}textless 20 : 1 by mass. In particular, NH4+ and urea favored non-heterocystous cyanobacteria and chlorophytes and NO3-, urea promoted chlorophytes, some cyanobacteria, and transient blooms of siliceous algae, whereas N-2-fixing cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates exhibited little response to added N. Added N also increased microcystin production by up to 13-fold in August and September, although the magnitude of response varied with N species and predominant algal taxon (Planktothrix agardhii, Microcystis spp.). These findings demonstrate that pollution with N intensifies eutrophication and algal toxicity in lakes with elevated concentrations of SRP and low N: P, and that the magnitude of these effects depends on the chemical form, and hence source, of N.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the biogeochemical processes that control the benthic fluxes of dissolved nitrogen (N) species in Boknis Eck - a 28 m deep site in the Eckernförde Bay (southwestern Baltic Sea). Bottom water oxygen concentrations (O2-BW) fluctuate greatly over the year at Boknis Eck, being well-oxygenated in winter and experiencing severe bottom water hypoxia and even anoxia in late summer. The present communication addresses the winter situation (February 2010). Fluxes of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) were simulated using a benthic model that accounted for transport and biogeochemical reactions and constrained with ex situ flux measurements and sediment geochemical analysis. The sediments were a net sink for NO3- (-0.35 mmol m-2 d-1 of NO3-), of which 75\% was ascribed to dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA) by sulfide oxidizing bacteria, and 25\% to NO3- reduction to NO2- by denitrifying microorganisms. NH4+ fluxes were high (1.74 mmol m-2 d-1 of NH4+), mainly due to the degradation of organic nitrogen, and directed out of the sediment. NO2- fluxes were negligible. The sediments in Boknis Eck are, therefore, a net source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = NO3- + NO2- + NH4+) during winter. This is in large part due to bioirrigation, which accounts for 76\% of the benthic efflux of NH4+, thus reducing the capacity for nitrification of NH4+. The combined rate of fixed N loss by denitrification and anammox was estimated at 0.08 mmol m-2 d-1 of N2, which is at the lower end of previously reported values. A systematic sensitivity analysis revealed that denitrification and anammox respond strongly and positively to the concentration of NO3- in the bottom water (NO3-BW). Higher O2-BW decreases DNRA and denitrification but stimulates both anammox and the contribution of anammox to total N2 production (\%Ramx). A complete mechanistic explanation of these findings is provided. Our analysis indicates that nitrification is the geochemical driving force behind the observed correlation between \%Ramx and water depth in the seminal study of Dalsgaard et al. (2005). Despite remaining uncertainties, the results provide a general mechanistic framework for interpreting the existing knowledge of N-turnover processes and fluxes in continental margin sediments, as well as predicting the types of environment where these reactions are expected to occur prominently. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Sediment chemistry, microbial and meiofaunal assemblages were investigated from March 1997 to February 1998 on monthly basis at two stations: the first was located under the mussel farm, while the second was at about 1-km distance and served as control. Benthic response to changes in the biodepositional regime was investigated in terms of biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter, phytopigment content, bacterial abundance and composition and meiofaunal community structure. A large accumulation of chloroplastic pigments, proteins and lipids was observed under the mussel farm. Such changes in the sedimentary conditions reflected the accumulation of faeces and pseudo-faeces and led to the creation of reducing conditions. Microbial assemblages beneath the mussel cultures increased their densities and displayed, when compared to the control, a larger cyanobacterial importance associated to a strong decrease of the picoeukaryotic cell density. Farm sediments displayed significant changes in meiofaunal density: turbellarian, ostracod and kinorhynch densities decreased significantly, while copepods remained constant or increased possibly profiting of the enrichment in microphytobenthic biomass associated to mussel biodeposits. The comparative analysis of the mussel biodeposition and fish-farm impact on sediments beneath the cultures revealed that mussel farms induced a considerably lower disturbance on benthic community structure.

	abstract = {We measured benthic denitrification (DN) and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA) using the isotope-pairing technique in three tropical estuaries in Thailand (Mae Klong), Indonesia (Cisadane), and Fiji (Vunidawa-Rewa) during rainy, dry, and intermediate seasons along the salinity gradient of each estuary. DNRA dominated. Anammox (AN) was measured initially but neither AN activity nor AN bacteria-related 16S ribosomal RNA genes were detected in any of the estuaries. DN was either zero or extremely low, driven by water column nitrate and not from benthic nitrification-DN. N2O was not formed during DN. N2O saturations in estuary water were low, except in the nutrified Indonesian estuary, and tropical estuaries are therefore likely to be only small sources of N2O. Benthic nitrate reduction was nitrate limited; when nitrate was enhanced experimentally, DN increased slightly, but DNRA increased proportionately much more. Predominance of DNRA over DN in tropical estuaries may be due both to an energetic advantage (greater standard free energy change, DG degrees) of nitrate ammonifiers over denitrifiers when competing for limited nitrate, and also to higher affinity for nitrate by the nitrate ammonifiers. At tropical temperatures the three processes occur in the order DNRA {\textbackslash}textgreater DN {\textbackslash}textgreater AN. In contrast, temperate estuaries, at lower temperature and higher nitrate concentrations, exhibit proportionately greater levels of AN and DN. The Cisadane estuary became anoxic during the dry season, with high ammonium and sulfide, but no nitrate reduction because of lack of nitrate. Addition of nitrate stimulated high rates of autotrophic DN driven by sulfide, but not DNRA.},

Nitrification rates are highest near the base of the euphotic zone in the open ocean, and in sediments in the coastal region. High nitrate concentrations in deep water probably result from slow accumulation due to low nitrification rates coupled to the absence of a significant sink for nitrate in oxygenated deep water. 4. Environmental factors with mediate the rate of nitrification include light intensity, substrate concentration and oxygen concentration. Nitrification is subject to inhibition by a number of different chemicals, which may influence its rate in the environment. 5. Nitrification has been implicated in the production of nitric and nitrous oxides in the ocean. Trace gas production is enhanced at low oxygen tensions. In oxygen minimum zones, nitrification is coupled to denitrification, leading to net loss of fixed nitrogen.},

The major impact identified was on the sea bottom, resulting in the development of reducing and anoxic sediments, high sediment oxygen demand, production of hydrogen sulphide and elimination/decrease in benthos. The impact on water quality was less conspicuous. A decrease in dissolved oxygen was observed at all sites while increases in ammonia, inorganic P, nitrate and nitrite were observed only at sites with poor tidal flushing and high stocking density. However, no significant changes in total suspended solids, light extinction coefficient, chlorophyll a, phaeopigment and E. coli were found near the fish rafts at any sites. Environmental impacts vary considerably between sites, and were significantly reduced at sites with good water circulation and low stocking density. Despite the high organic and nutrient loadings generated by marine fish farming activities, the impacts on water quality and sediments at all sites were localised and did not appear to extend beyond a distance of 1-1.5 km from the fish rafts.

To achieve this objective, we chose 3 marine fish farms located along the coast of Sicily (Mediterranean Sea) as point-source disturbances, and a control area. The hypothesis that carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of particulate (POM) and sedimentary (SOM) organic matter varied with increasing distance (from cages to 1000 m) was tested at 3 levels of hydrodynamics: low (mean velocity of current [MVC] {\textasciitilde}12 cm s–1), intermediate (MVC {\textasciitilde}22 cm s–1), and high (MVC {\textasciitilde}40 cm s–1). Different isotopic signals from allochthonous (fish waste) over natural (phytoplankton, terrigenous, and sand microflora) inputs allowed identification of the ‘spatial effect regime’ of fish farming. The increasing water current velocities seem to proportionally enlarge the relative area of influence of the cages, particularly on sediments. At low hydrodynamics, an increasing contribution of terrigenous signals was inferred: POM and SOM showing a depleted gradient of C (ranging from –22.0 to –24.0‰) and N (from 5.0 to 2.0‰). At an intermediate hydrodynamic level, C and N showed a slight increase in waste contribution, particularly in POM (δ15N from 2.6 to {\textasciitilde}4.0‰). At high hydrodynamics, an enriching isotopic gradient (δ15NPOM-SOM from 1.8 to 4.6‰) suggested a notable contribution of fish waste. Accordingly, the dispersal of waste from the cages seemed to be related to movements at the bottom of the water column, confirming the recently identified role played by resuspension movements.},

	abstract = {Abstract A spatially explicit coupled hydrodynamic-mass transport model system was used to simulate dispersal of particulate organic matter from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farming in central Norway. Model setups of 32 m horizontal resolution were run for periods of up to 650 days for 3 sites of different oceanographic characteristics: one fjord location, one medium-exposed location influenced by fjord water and one coastal location. Records on feed used for each cage at each location were converted to feces released based on a published mass balance model. The results from the simulations were compared with scores from corresponding mandatory benthic surveys (MOM-B) of the sediment layer beneath the farms. The correspondence between simulated and measured thickness of the sediment layer was good, and improved with the inclusion of resuspension processes. At all sites the distribution of organic matter in the bottom layer was non-homogeneous, with significant temporal variation and transport and settling of matter up to at least 0.5 km away from one of the farms. Our results indicate that the monitoring practice used in Norway until now, with a few sediment grab samples taken mainly within the fish farm, may not adequately determine the areal impacts of all salmon farming operations. The patchy distribution of organic matter and the correspondence between simulation and survey results is attributed to the use of full 3D current fields of a high spatiotemporal resolution and a good model for resuspension processes that some previous model studies have failed to properly account for.},

	abstract = {To delineate patterns in the gradients of macrobenthic communities around fish farms and to generate site-selection guidelines for sustainable fish farms, a quantitative survey was conducted in August-September 1998 and in February 1999 in fishfarming areas along the coast of Kumano-nada, central Japan. The biomass peaked in sediments containing 1.2 mg=g of total nitrogen or 9.2 mg=g of total organic carbon, suggesting that these values are indicative of possible aerobic mineralization of the loaded organic wastes. Macrobenthos was scarcely found in sediments with acid-volatile sulfides (AVS) {\textgreater}1.9 mg S=g, which suggests critical AVS conditions for maintaining sustainable and environmentally “friendly” aquaculture. An index, “ED,” which serves as an index for bathymetry of the sampling site, was devised. ED was highly correlated with four community parameters (biomass, density, species diversity, and species richness) and with five environmental factors (sediment total nitrogen, total organic carbon, total phosphorus and acid-volatile sulfides, and bottom-water dissolved oxygen). Compared with small-scale farms, environmental deterioration and decline in macrofauna were obvious in large-scale farms (\_600 t=yr of fish production) that were located in inner parts of embayments and that had comparatively high ED values. However, in areas near open waters and that had comparatively low ED values, the impacts of aquacultural activities were not clear. These findings suggest that the variation in macrobenthos and environmental factors found in the study area was attributable principally to the area’s bathymetry and, secondly, to aquacultural activities. Seven assemblages, recognized on the basis of cluster analysis, were placed in a gradient of ED versus fish production. These assemblages were classified into three groups: a group characteristic of a healthy zone, a group characteristic of a cautionary zone, and a group characteristic of a critical zone. As fish production increased, the location of the assemblage characteristic of the cautionary zone shifted to more open, deeper areas (lower ED values). An azoic-site group was composed of large-scale farms in a stagnant basin. The community type of the macrobenthos in the vicinity of open-water, net-pen fish farms is an indicator of the condition and assimilative capacity of the benthic environment in that area and can be used to evaluate the suitability of the site for continued fish farming. The index of embayment degree, ED, can be used as a simple and effective substitute indicator for this evaluation.},

Although biological processes that catalyze the reductive side of the iron cycle are established, little is known about microbial oxidative processes on iron cycling in sedimentary environments—resulting in the formation of iron oxides. Here we show that a potential source of sedimentary iron oxides originates from the metabolic activity of iron-oxidizing bacteria from the class Zetaproteobacteria, presumably enhanced by burrowing animals in coastal sediments. Zetaproteobacteria were estimated to be a global total of 1026 cells in coastal, bioturbated sediments, and predicted to annually produce 8 × 1015 g of Fe in sedimentary iron oxides—55 times larger than the annual flux of iron oxides deposited by rivers. These data suggest that iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria are keystone organisms in marine sedimentary environments—despite their low numerical abundance—yet exert a disproportionate impact via the rejuvenation of iron oxides.},

Existing quantitative models of bioirrigation rely primarily on chemical, rather than ecological, information and the depth-dependence of bioirrigation intensity is either imposed or constrained through a data fitting procedure. In this study, stochastic simulations of 3D burrow networks are used to calculate mean densities, volumes and wall surface areas of burrows, as well as their variabilities, as a function of sediment depth. Burrow networks of the following model organisms are considered: the polychaete worms Nereis diversicolor and Schizocardium sp., the shrimp Callianassa subterranea, the echiuran worm Maxmuelleria lankesteri, the fiddler crabs Uca minax, U. pugnax and U. pugilator, and the mud crabs Sesarma reticulatum and Eurytium limosum. Consortia of these model organisms are then used to predict burrow networks in a shallow water carbonate sediment at Dry Tortugas, FL, and in two intertidal saltmarsh sites at Sapelo Island, GA. Solute-specific nonlocal bioirrigation coefficients are calculated from the depth-dependent burrow surface areas and the radial diffusive length scale around the burrows. Bioirrigation coefficients for sulfate obtained from network simulations, with the diffusive length scales constrained by sulfate reduction rate profiles, agree with independent estimates of bioirrigation coefficients based on pore water chemistry. Bioirrigation coefficients for O2 derived from the stochastic model, with the diffusion length scales constrained by O2 microprofiles measured at the sediment/water interface, are larger than irrigation coefficients based on vertical pore water chemical profiles. This reflects, in part, the rapid attenuation with depth of the O2 concentration within the burrows, which reduces the driving force for chemical transfer across the burrow walls. Correction for the depletion of O2 in the burrows results in closer agreement between stochastically-derived and chemically-derived irrigation coefficient profiles.},

Here, we show how three functionally contrasting sediment-dwelling marine invertebrates affect fluid and particle transport - important processes in mediating nutrient cycling - and use high-resolution reconstructions of burrow geometry to determine the extent and nature of biogenic modification. We find that individual functional effect descriptors fall short of being able to adequately characterize how species mediate the stocks and flows of important ecosystem properties and that, in contrary to common practice and understanding, they are not substitutable with one another because they emphasize different aspects of species activity and behavior. When information derived from these metrics is combined with knowledge of how species behave and modify their environment, however, detailed mechanistic information emerges that increases the likelihood that a species functional standing will be appropriately summarized. Our study provides evidence that more comprehensive functional effect descriptors are required if they are to be of value to those tasked with projecting how altered biodiversity will influence future ecosystems.},

Because of difficulties in species identification, little is known about species-dependent sediment reworking and solute transport. The closely related species are apparently similar in feeding and sediment-dwelling behavior, but size and burrowing depth indicate differences in bioturbation and the biogeochemical consequences thereof. To investigate these potential differences, a tracer experiment with artificial particles (luminophores) and solute tracer (bromide) was conducted. Polychaetes were identified to species level using a molecular genetic key. Modeled results show that all three species display markedly low particle reworking rates with biodiffusion coefficients (Db) of 1.76 cm2 yr−1 (M. viridis) and 0.07 cm2 yr−1 (M. neglecta) at an abundance of 1273 individuals m−2 and 0.44 cm2 yr−1 (M. arctia) at twice that abundance. Nonlocal transport coefficients are negligible in all cases. Solute transport by M. neglecta and M. viridis are more similar to one another than to M. arctia, whose solute transport mode is much more diffusive in character (10.9-fold enhanced diffusivity with nonlocal irrigation coefficients [α] of 55.3 yr−1) than that of the two other species, which affect tracer distributions in the sediment predominantly through a nonlocal, advective transport mode (α of 108.9 yr−1 M. viridis and 130.9 yr−1 M. neglecta). Thus, a functional grouping of the sibling species in terms of bioirrigation is not recommended.},

The index was validated with combined field (in situ communities) and manipulative (single species) experiments. Results from both community and single-species experimental incubations indicate that IPc is able to predict the bioirrigation rate in different sediment types (mud, fine sand, sand). The trait-based index thus demonstrates robustness in the prediction of animal-mediated functional processes that support biogeochemical functions under variable environmental conditions. Accordingly, we argue that trait-based indices provide a useful tool for the quantitative prediction of ecosystem processes as effect traits provide a direct link to the behavioral mechanisms that drive ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {Bioirrigation
the animal-induced exchange of solutes between pore water and overlying water - is a key process in sediments with profound implications for biogeochemical processes such as nutrient cycling and organic matter regeneration at the sediment water interface. There is an urgent need to understand how a changing environment will affect the irrigation activity of macrofauna and vice versa. A shift in species composition (e.g. from deep burrowing species to smaller, more opportunistic and shallow burrowing species) will have large effects on bioirrigation and thus on ecosystem function (such as benthic pelagic coupling). Considering the difficulties to determine area-covering rates of bioirrigation (e.g. in terms tracer-based fluxes) and the complexity of interactions of multiple species in the community that prohibit a direct measure of bioirrigation attributable to each species, a mechanistically-based approach is needed to predict relative intensities of bioirrigation activity based on the fundamental functional traits. We propose a conceptual framework to develop an index of bioirrigation that takes into account the biological mechanisms of bioirrigation and provides a simplified, yet functionally based approach to quantify the bioirrigation potential of benthic communities. We developed the community bioirrigation potential (BIPc) that provides a biomass- and abundance-weighted scoring system considering functional traits related to pore water and solute exchange. It may be used as a supplement to established methods to assess the function of marine soft sediments related bioirrigation. In analogy to the particle-related community bioturbation potential of Solan et al. (2004), context dependent organismal traits that affect ventilation and bioirrigation (feeding type, morphology of burrows, and burrowing depth) are combined with the data on abundance and biomass of the respective species. These are subsequently summed up to a community bioirrigation potential (BIPc). This review considers ecological traits relevant for bioirrigation and their classification into a bioirrigation index. Furthermore the necessary simplifications in the index (e.g. limiting its applicability to interfacial nutrient fluxes) are discussed. We also provide a working example from the southwestern Baltic Sea to illustrate the practical application of the index and a compilation of key species related to this area containing their classification into the considered bioirrigation traits.},

M. viridis showed deep burrowing with efficient bioirrigation (11 L m−2 day−1) and high survival (71\%) in HSS, while M. arctia exhibited shallow burrowing with high bioirrigation (12 L m−2 day−1) and survival (88\%) in LSM. M. neglecta behaved poorly in both ecological settings (bioirrigation, 5–6 L m−2 day−1; survival, 21–44\%). The deep M. viridis bioirrigation enhanced total microbial CO2 (TCO2) production in HSS by 175\% with a net efflux of NH4+ and PO43−, at rates 3- to 27-fold higher than for the other species. Although the shallow and intense bioirrigation of M. arctia in LSM stimulated microbial TCO2 production to some extent (61\% enhancement), the nutrient fluxes close to zero indicate that it effectively prevented the P release. Porewater Fe:PO43− ratios revealed that the oxidizing effect of M. arctia bioirrigation increased the PO43− adsorption capacity of LSM twofold relative to defaunated controls while no buffering of PO43− was detected in M. viridis HSS treatment. Therefore, the different behaviour of the three species in various environments and the sharp contrast between M. viridis and M. arctia effects on C, N and P cycling must be considered carefully when the ecological role of Marenzelleria species in the Baltic Sea is evaluated.},

reworking and bioirrigation activities. The aim of this study was to compare the influences of bioturbation activities by 3 dominant species of shallow water habitats (Cerastoderma edule, Corophium volutator, and Nereis diversicolor)
on microbial communities and biogeochemical processes in sediment cores. C. edule acted as a biodiffuser, mixing surface particles in the top 2 cm of the sediment. Despite this mixing activity, this species had little effect on O2
consumption, water exchange between the water column and the sediment, microbial characteristics, and release of nutrients from the sediment. In contrast, C. volutator and N. diversicolor produced burrows in the sediment that allowed
transport of surface particles into biogenic structures. These 2 species doubled the solute exchange between the water column and the sediment. Such modifications of sediment structure and solute transport increased the O2 consumption and the
release of nutrients from the sediment. Both C. volutator and N. diversicolor stimulated the microbial communities as indicated by higher percentages of active bacteria. Reduction of the numbers of sulphate reducing bacteria was observed
when the 3 invertebrates were present and could be attributed to the penetration of O2 due to animal activities. N. diversicolor had a greater influence than C. volutator on pore water chemistry, ammonium release, and active
bacteria. As N. diversicolor burrowed deeper in the sediment than C. volutator, it irrigated a greater volume of sediment. The modes of sediment reworking and structure building, irrigation behaviour, and burrowing depths were factors
sufficient to assign the 3 species into different functional groups.},

The lugworm Arenicola marina is a widespread and dominant large burrower at European Atlantic shores, and a major source of bioturbation and bioirrigation on the extensive intertidal flats in the Wadden Sea (eastern North Sea). The hypothesis that lugworm activities inhibit the successive development from sandy to muddy sediments in depositional embayments has been tested by a large-scale exclusion field experiment. Changes in sediment properties indicate a progressive clogging of interstices with fine particles and organic matter, resulting in lower sediment permeability in exclusion areas compared to lugworm inhabited control areas. Chlorophyll content in the surface layer was consistently higher in the absence of lugworms. Lack of sub-surface irrigation in the absence of lugworms combined with reduced sediment permeability resulted in increased concentrations of ammonium, phosphate, silicate, and sulphide in the pore-water. Concentrations {\textgreater}100μM of sulphide gave rise to toxic conditions for macrofauna. The effects of lugworms on sediment characteristics were more conspicuous in fine than in medium sand. It is concluded that A. marina contributes to the maintenance of permeable sand and thereby sustaining suitable conditions for the lugworm population itself. Without this “ecosystem engineer” mud flats would greatly expand at the expense of sand flats in the Wadden Sea.},

We performed experiments with sediment aquaria that contained each species separately as well as a non-bioturbated control. Bacterial communities in different sediment zones (surface, burrow, subsurface) were characterized by phospholipid-derived fatty acid analysis combined with stable isotope labeling (13C bicarbonate) to quantify the dark CO2 fixation by chemoautotrophic bacteria. Pore water chemistry (ΣH2S and dissolved inorganic carbon) was additionally assessed in each treatment. The strong ventilation but low bioirrigation capacity in the open-ended burrows of N. diversicolor resulted in enhanced aerobic chemoautotrophic activity, potentially by sulfur oxidizing and nitrifying bacteria along the burrow. In contrast, slower ventilation and higher irrigation by M. viridis induced an advective mode of pore water transport. This promotes anaerobic chemoautotrophy around the blind-ended burrow and within the subsurface sediment. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were the dominant anaerobic chemoautotrophs that probably disproportionate sulfur. In conclusion, our analysis shows that bioturbating fauna influence the microbial community and chemoautotrophic activity in sediments, but that the effect strongly depends on the structure of the burrow and on species-specific ventilation behavior and irrigation capacity.},

	abstract = {Loss of bioturbating key species from marine sediments has been shown to strongly reduce benthic biogeochemical cycling and ecosystem functioning. It is thus of paramount importance to identify key bioturbators and quantify their effect on biogeochemical processes. To do so trait based community and species bioturbation potential (BPc and BPi) was mapped for 423 North Sea stations in the German Bight. Mapping of BPc and BPi identified Amphiura filiformis, Echinocardium cordatum and Nucula nitidosa as major bioturbating species in the German Bight. The effects of these species on benthic nutrient flux (i.e., changing concentrations of silicate ∆[SiO2], ammonium ∆[NH4+], nitrate ∆[NO3−] and nitrite ∆[NO2−]) were quantified in laboratory experiments together with their bioturbation rate (Db) and bioirrigation activity. The experiments indicated that mapped species bioturbation potential (BPi) may be a poor tool for identifying key bioturbators while calculated experimental BPi (expBPi) was a good indicator for species impact on biogeochemical cycling. Out of the three investigated species only E. cordatum significantly influenced biogeochemical cycling, whereas the effect of A. filiformis remained inconclusive potentially because arm damage and regeneration may affect the bioturbation activity of many individuals. The bivalve N. nitidosa showed only little impact on biogeochemical cycling, although this species was found to be an active bioturbator. Accordingly, E. cordatum may be considered one of the most important contributors to biogeochemical cycling at the sediment-water interface in the German Bight.},
